Dear Fellow Shareholders:
On behalf of the entire Board of Directors of Heritage Financial Corporation (“Heritage”, 
“Company”) and Heritage Bank (“Bank”), thank you for your investment in the Company. We 
continue to strive to improve all levels of the organization to achieve optimal performance. 
As we reflect on 2024, we are pleased with our overall operational performance despite the 
short-term negative impacts from restructuring the balance sheet. Net income was $43.3 
million, or $1.24 per diluted share, for the year ended 2024 compared to $61.8 million, or 
$1.75 per diluted share, for the year ended 2023. Heritage grew total loans a robust 10.8%, 
while maintaining solid credit quality with net charge-offs on average loans of 0.06%. 
Capital also remained strong with a 13.3% total risk-based capital ratio as of December 
31, 2024. Our net interest margin decreased 25 basis points to 3.33% for the year ended 
December 31, 2024, compared to 3.58% for the year ended December 31, 2023, due 
primarily to upward market pressure related to deposit costs; however, our net interest 
margin improved to 3.39% for the fourth quarter of 2024. The Heritage stock price closed at 
$24.50 on December 31, 2024, resulting in a three-year total shareholder return of 13.2%.
The Company announced in June 2024 that Jeff Deuel will retire in May 2025. He is being 
succeeded by Bryan McDonald who took the role of President and Chief Executive Officer 
(“CEO”) of the Bank and President of the Company in July 2024. It is anticipated that Mr. 
McDonald will become President and CEO of the Company and a member of the Board 
upon the retirement of Mr. Deuel. As part of this succession plan, the Bank also hired 
Nicholas Bley in October 2024 as its Chief Operating Officer.
Effective January 1, 2025, we welcomed a new director, Karen Saunders, to the board. 
Karen brings extensive financial services expertise from her experience with KPMG LLP 
where she served as the Pacific Northwest Region’s lead partner in community banking 
until her recent retirement. We want to thank Jeff Deuel and Debbie Gavin for their years 
of service on the board as they both plan to retire following our annual shareholders’ 
meeting in May 2025. We are also pleased with our recent announcement expanding the 
footprint into Spokane, Washington.
As we look forward, we remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives, providing 
our employees with a collaborative and constructive culture, our customers with enhanced 
services and increasing satisfaction, and our shareholders with improving shareholder value. 
We continue to work hard to make the right long-term investments to drive sustainable 
shareholder value and with this focus in mind, the Company supported a 4.3% increase in 
quarterly dividends to $0.24 per common share during the first quarter of 2025.
On behalf of the Board of Directors and the management team, we want to thank you again 
for your ongoing support.  
Sincerely, 
    
Brian L. Vance Jeffrey J. Deuel

theb ankinga gencies since1 983. Them inimumsh aveb een expressedi nt erms of ratios of “capital” divided by “total assets.”
Beginning in 1989, thec apital guidelines forU .S.b ankingo rganizations haveb een based upon international capitala ccords
(knowna s“ Basel” accords) adopted by theB asel Committeeo nB ankingS upervision, ac ommitteeo fc entralb anksa nd bank

(the “Basel III Rule”). TheB asel III Rule established capitals tandards forb ankingo rganizations that arem eaningfully more
stringent than thosee stablished previouslyand arestill ineffect today.
TheB asel III Rule isapplicablet oa ll bankingo rganizations that aresubjectt om inimum capitalr equirements, including national

introduced in theB asel Ia ccord, bank assets were divided into four basicrisk-weighted categorieso f0 %, 20%,5 0%,a nd 100%.
TheB asel III accordsr equiredamore complex, detaileda nd calibrateda ssessment of risk in thec alculation of risk weightings.
Although it uses thes amet echnique introduced bytheB asel Ia ccordi na ssigning assets torisk-weight categories, it significantly

Well-Capitalized Requirements. Ther atiosd escribed abovea re minimums tandards in order forb ankingo rganizations to be

“well-capitalized” and, to that end, federal lawa nd regulations providev arious incentives forb ankingo rganizations to maintain
regulatoryc apitala tl evelsi ne xcess of minimumr egulatoryr equirements. Fore xample,abank ingo rganization that is well-
capitalized may: (i)q ualifyf or exemptions from priorn oticeo ra pplicationr equirementso therwisea pplicablet oc ertain types of

Under thec apitalr egulations of theF ederal Reservef or theC ompany andtheF DICf or theB ank,i no rder to be well capitalized,

•A ratioo fT otal Capitalt ot otal risk-weighted assets of 10% ormore;a nd
