DEAR SHAREHOLDERS, 
 
2024 was another strong year for American Express. We delivered record-setting results by continuing to 
execute our strategy of investing in our value propositions, coverage, marketing, technology, and talent.  
 
As we prepare to celebrate our company’s 175th anniversary this month, I am incredibly grateful for our 
Card Members, merchants and partners for their loyalty and support; and I am immensely proud of our 
colleagues who continue to deliver innovative products and services for our customers, while staying 
true to our brand built on trust, security, and service since our earliest days.  
 
2024 Year-in-Review  
 
Our full-year 2024 results set new records across key metrics. We delivered record revenues of $66 
billion for the year, up 9 percent or 10 percent on an FX-adjusted basis1; and we had record annual net 
income of over $10 billion, or $14.01 per share, up 25 percent year-over-year including the gain from 
Accertify2. Full-year revenue growth was consistent with the growth aspirations we have for the 
company over the long-term, while EPS growth was higher.  
 
We also saw record levels of annual Card Member spending and record net card fees, which has grown 
at double digit levels for 26 consecutive quarters. During the year, we acquired a record 13 million new 
proprietary cards and saw continued high Card Member retention, while maintaining our best-in-class 
credit performance and disciplined expense management.  
 
Throughout 2024, we continued to enrich our Membership Model, refreshing over 40 products globally, 
including the U.S. Consumer Gold Card and Delta cobrand cards, enhancing our dining portfolio with the 
acquisitions of Tock and Rooam, and launching several new top-tier sponsorships and experiences, such 
as our multi-year global partnership with Formula 1.  
 
Millennial and Gen Z consumers were our fastest growing age cohort in terms of both new account 
acquisitions and Card Member spending, demonstrating that our premium value propositions are 
resonating and driving strong engagement with younger customers. We also continued to grow our 
small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) customer base in the U.S., with strong new Card acquisitions 
throughout the year. Our International Card Services segment continued to deliver double-digit billings 
growth, with strength in both Consumer and Commercial customers. We also added millions of new 
merchant locations globally in 2024 as we continued to expand coverage. 
 
These results—powered by over 75,000 exceptional colleagues—demonstrate that our strategy is 
working, enabling us to drive sustained top-line growth, superior earnings, and strong returns for our 
shareholders.

Celebrating Our 175 Years of Growth & Innovation  
 
On March 18th, American Express will celebrate a major milestone – 175 years in business. It has been a 
journey of innovation, transformation and resiliency.  
 
By continuously reinventing ourselves, challenging the status quo and evolving to serve our customers, 
colleagues and communities in new and innovative ways, we transformed from an express delivery 
company into the global premium ﬁnancial and lifestyle company that we are today. Throughout our 
journey, the one thing that remained constant has been our brand promise of trust, security, and service. 
This unique combination of a resilient brand and continuous innovation is how we have been delivering 
“The Powerful Backing of American Express ”tm  for 175 years. 
 
 
 
American Express was established as a freight delivery company in 1850, soon after the California Gold 
Rush set oﬀ the great westward migration across the country.  We delivered all kinds of goods with 
horses, wagons, and trains and what stood us apart was our promise to make good on any losses if 
something unfortunate happened to our customers’ belongings. We backed our customers, and we 
earned their trust. As our reputation of reliable service continued to grow, our business expanded 
nationwide, and then internationally. By the early 20th century, we had American Express oﬃces across 
Europe, Asia and Latin America. 
 
As we grew internationally, we recognized that our customers needed a safe way to move cash, in 
addition to goods. To meet this need, we introduced American Express® Money Orders in 1882, marking 
our entry into ﬁnancial services. Once again, we diﬀerentiated our Money Order oﬀering by 
guaranteeing to fully protect customers against loss, fraud, or delays. This move paved the way for our 
ﬁrst major innovation in 1891 - the introduction of the Travelers Cheque, which provided our customers 
with a secure and convenient way to exchange money while they traveled. This invention also had a 
unique watermark and a countersignature that made the cheques diﬃcult to counterfeit, reinforcing our 
reputation for security.  

--- PAGE 4 END ---
iii 
 
 
A few decades later, we made the decision to enter the travel business, which stemmed from the trust 
our customers put in our colleagues at Express oﬃces around the world to provide them travel advice 
while cashing Travelers Cheques.  The decision to enter the travel business, while hotly debated at the 
time for fear it would distract from our core Express business, was timely, as the U.S. government ended 
up consolidating the country’s railroads a decade later, putting an end to the nation’s express companies. 
With that, we transformed our Express locations around the world into travel oﬃces that served as a 
home away from home for customers, and travel services became our core business for the next six 
decades. 
 
 
 
Our reputation for powerfully backing our customers, colleagues, and communities, particularly when 
they needed us the most, was solidiﬁed during this period. During the World Wars, colleagues in our 
international oﬃces helped hundreds of stranded travelers escape from war-torn areas, often risking 
their lives. And when the Great Depression hit in the 1930s and many ﬁnancial institutions faced bank 
failures and insolvency, we stayed open to cash Travelers Cheques and money orders, even when the 
U.S. government declared a national Bank Holiday. 
 
After several decades of continuing to build our reputation of trust, security, and service in the travel and 
Travelers Cheque business, we made another bold decision that led to our next major transformation. 
After a series of intense debates between those who saw credit cards as the wave of the future and 
those who saw them as a threat to our thriving Travelers Cheque business, in 1958, we introduced the 
American Express® Card in the U.S. and Canada. Our ﬁrst card was purple and printed on paper, as a nod 
to our popular Travelers Cheques. A year later, we introduced our ﬁrst plastic card in 1959 and changed 
its color to green, which we still oﬀer today.  In 1964, we started printing “Member Since” on our cards 
to recognize our customers’ loyalty and as a reminder that American Express is more than a card – it’s a 
Membership people aspire to belong to. This was the beginning of our premium Membership Model – 
one of our key competitive advantages to this day.

While this was a great time for innovation at American Express, a major test of the company’s reputation 
came in late 1963. American Express Warehousing, Ltd., a company subsidiary, was the victim of a major 
customer fraud involving the non-existent inventory of salad oil, making the subsidiary liable for $144 
million in loans. That was more than triple the parent company’s total capital at the time. The 
speculation around this scandal – which later became known as the Salad Oil Scandal – was big enough 
to cause our stock price to lose more than half its value. In a bold decision at the time, American Express 
committed to settling all legal claims even though it could have walked away and left the subsidiary’s 
creditors with the bill. We knew one of our most valuable assets is our promise of trust and the damage 
to our reputation by not settling the claims would have proved more costly over the long term. During 
this time, one young investor recognized the value of our core business, which was proﬁtable and sound, 
and understood signiﬁcance of the decision to fulﬁll on our brand promise. As a result, he decided to 
initiate a stake in American Express, and built up his position over time. That investor was Warren 
Buﬀett, who, through Berkshire Hathaway, remains our largest shareholder today.  
 
Continuing our thread of customer-focused innovation, we launched our ﬁrst Corporate Card in 1966 to 
back our business customers, then the iconic Platinum Card® in 1984, the ﬁrst premium, “by-invitation-
only” card of its kind that redeﬁned what people came to expect from a credit card. In 1987, we 
expanded our capabilities into lending with the launch of our ﬁrst revolving credit card – the Optima® 
Card – providing our customers with the ﬂexibility to pay their balances over time to meet more of their 
ﬁnancial needs. Our ﬁrst card speciﬁcally designed for small business owners was introduced in 1988, 
and today we are the leading issuer of small business cards in the U.S.3

In the decades to follow, we continued to expand our card portfolio and enhance Membership value, 
launching one of the industry’s ﬁrst multi-airline rewards programs, Membership Miles, which later 
evolved into Membership Rewards®. We designed our products and services with diﬀerentiated beneﬁts 
and experiences to help ensure “Membership Has Its Privileges,” including leading travel and dining 
oﬀerings, and exclusive access to experiences across sports and entertainment, as well as products and 
services that help business owners manage expenses and build their business. In the late 1990s, we also 
introduced the sought after Centurion® Card, an invitation only oﬀering that continues to be the ultimate 
in cachet, generating many references across pop culture.  
 
By focusing on delivering best-in-class products, services and experiences that met our customers’ 
evolving needs, we continuously enhanced and evolved our value propositions, driving relevance across 
generations, customer segments, and geographies. As a result, a card that was originally printed on 
paper has now become an essential part of everyday lives of millions of people and businesses, and 
continues to grow around the world. 
 
Another major shift we made in the mid-1990s was to embrace partnerships with other world class 
companies by beginning to issue cobrand cards, ﬁrst with Hilton and then Delta, both of which remain 
important strategic partners today. We also made a push to expand merchant acceptance in locations 
where our customers shopped every day, including grocery stores, gas stations and drug stores. And we 
focused on growing our merchant network globally to be in more places where our customers live, work, 
and travel. To do this eﬃciently, we made another bold decision to allow banks to issue American 
Express® cards on our network and formed our Global Network Services (GNS) business in 1996 to 
execute our expansion strategy. GNS has been a key enabler of our growth to reach approximately 108 
million merchant locations in force around the world in 2024.4  
 
Throughout the 2000s, we continued to show up for our customers, colleagues and communities during 
good times and bad. Following the 9/11 attacks, we pledged to keep our headquarters in lower 
Manhattan, a place that had been our home since shortly after our founding in 1850, and supported the 
neighborhood’s revitalization. By the middle of the decade, we had introduced hundreds of new card 

--- PAGE 7 END ---
vi 
 
products around the world, including through bank issuing partners, and continued our small business 
oﬀerings with the launch of OPEN. But then, the Great Recession hit, which drove our decision to 
become a bank holding company to enhance our access to liquidity while we navigated the market 
turmoil. During this time, we made another pivotal decision to launch our retail deposit program that 
ultimately transformed our funding model, and accounts for over 70 percent of our overall funding 
today. 
 
On the heels of the ﬁnancial crisis, one of our most impactful and lasting campaigns as a company was 
born out of our commitment to backing our customers and communities. In 2010, we created Small 
Business Saturday® to help drive customer traﬃc and spending at struggling small businesses so they 
could recover and thrive again. Since its inception, this innovative campaign evolved into a year-round, 
global Shop Small® movement, and has generated over $223 billion in reported consumer spending at 
small, independent retailers and restaurants on Small Business Saturday.5  
 
When COVID-19 upended every aspect of life around the world in 2020, we were once again guided by 
our commitment to backing our colleagues, customers, and communities. We prioritized the health and 
safety of our colleagues and committed to no pandemic-related layoﬀs in 2020 to provide them some 
certainty. We supported our customers by providing ﬁnancial relief programs and injecting new value 
into our products to oﬀer our Card Members beneﬁts relevant to their evolving needs. We also backed 
impacted communities and small businesses by launching our largest Shop Small campaign to date and 
partnered with Hilton and Marriott to provide free hotel rooms to ﬁrst responders.  
 
Simply put, we made sure that people and businesses could rely on The Powerful Backing of American 
Express throughout our history.  
 
Our focus on managing the company for the long term and backing our customers during the pandemic 
paid oﬀ. Since 2019, we’ve added millions of new premium customers to our Card Member base, more 
than doubled the global merchant locations in force, and signiﬁcantly grew our revenue base. We 
continuously enhanced our premium products and value propositions, refreshing over 150 of our 
products around the world and adding diﬀerentiated beneﬁts, access and experiences across travel, 
dining and entertainment. Our customer-focused innovations and the value enhancements over the past 
few years transformed our customer base, as Millennial and Gen-Z customers have become our fastest 
growing consumer cohort.   
 
By consistently executing our playbook and staying true to our brand, we have evolved into the global 
premium ﬁnancial and lifestyle company that we are today.

Looking Ahead: Long Runway for Growth & Innovation  
 
While it is hard to summarize 175 years in one letter, it is clear that the values of trust, security, and 
service have been the bedrock of our company and fueled our growth throughout our history, and they 
will continue to do so moving forward.  
 
Looking to the future, I am conﬁdent that we are well positioned to build on our strong foundation and 
drive sustained growth by continuing to deliver on our brand promise and innovate for our customers.  
 
My conﬁdence is driven by several factors. It starts with our diﬀerentiated business model, including our 
brand, global premium customer base at scale, and our network of partners. We are continuing to invest 
at high levels in our innovation engine, value propositions, marketing, and technology, while maintaining 
our excellent credit performance and expense discipline. We have many attractive growth opportunities 
across our customer base, particularly with Millennial and Gen Z consumers, SME customers, and in key 
countries outside the U.S. to build on our strong momentum.  
 
Most importantly, we have an exceptional team of colleagues around the world who are committed to 
successfully executing our strategy and delivering the best customer experience every day. With this 
winning team building on our remarkable history of innovation, transformation and resiliency, I have no 
doubt that the best days of American Express lie ahead.

Anti-MoneyLaunderingandCounteringtheFinancingofTerrorism

In theUnited States,themajority ofAML/CFTrequirements arederived fromtheCurrencyandForeignTransactions Reporting
Actand theaccompanyingregulationsissuedbytheU.S.DepartmentoftheT reasury(collectivelyreferredtoastheBank Secrecy

amended theBank SecrecyActand isintended to comprehensivelyreformandmodernize U.S.AML/CFTlaws.Manyofthe
statutoryprovisionsintheAMLAwillrequireadditionalrulemakings,re portsand othermeasures,and theimpactoftheAMLA
willdepend on,amongotherthings,rulemakingand implementation guidance.
In Europe,AML/CFTrequirementsarelargelytheresultofcountriestrans posingthe5th and 6th EUAnti-MoneyLaundering
Directives(and precedingEU Anti-MoneyLaunderingDirectives)intolocallawsand regulations.Numerousothercountrieshave
