Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results
Some of the statements, estimates or projections contained in this document are “forward-looking
statements” that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions with respect to us, including some statements
concerning future results, operations, outlooks, plans, goals, reputation, cash flows, liquidity and other events
which have not yet occurred. These statements are intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability
provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts are statements that could be
deemed forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and
projections about our business and the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our
management. We have tried, whenever possible, to identify these statements by using words like “will,”
“may,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” “depends,” “expect,” “goal,” “aspiration,” “anticipate,”
“forecast,” “project,” “future,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “target,” “indicate,” “outlook,” and similar
expressions of future intent or the negative of such terms.
Forward-looking statements include those statements that relate to our outlook and financial position
including, but not limited to, statements regarding:
• Pricing
• Booking levels
• Occupancy
• Interest, tax and fuel expenses
• Currency exchange rates
• Goodwill, ship and trademark fair values
• Liquidity and credit ratings
• Investment grade leverage metrics
• Estimates of ship depreciable lives and residual values
• Adjusted return on invested capital (“ROIC”)
Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are many factors that could cause
our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by
our forward-looking statements. This note contains important cautionary statements of the known factors
that we consider could materially affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial position. These factors include, but are not limited to, the
following:
• Events and conditions around the world, including geopolitical uncertainty, war and other military
actions, pandemics, inflation, higher fuel prices, higher interest rates and other general concerns impacting
the ability or desire of people to travel could lead to a decline in demand for cruises as well as have
significant negative impacts on our financial condition and operations.
• Incidents concerning our ships, guests or the cruise industry may negatively impact the satisfaction of
our guests and crew and lead to reputational damage.
• Changes in and non-compliance with laws and regulations under which we operate, such as those
relating to health, environment, safety and security, data privacy and protection, anti-money laundering,
anti-corruption, economic sanctions, trade protection, labor and employment, and tax may be costly
and lead to litigation, enforcement actions, fines, penalties and reputational damage.
• Factors associated with climate change, including evolving and increasing regulations, increasing global
concern about climate change and the shift in climate conscious consumerism and stakeholder scrutiny,
and increasing frequency and/or severity of adverse weather conditions could have a material impact
on our business.
• Inability to meet or achieve our targets, goals, aspirations, initiatives, and our public statements and
disclosures regarding them, including those related to sustainability matters, may expose us to risks that
may adversely impact our business.
• Cybersecurity incidents and data privacy breaches, as well as disruptions and other damages to our
principal offices, information technology operations and system networks and failure to keep pace with
developments in technology have adversely impacted and may in the future materially adversely impact
our business operations, the satisfaction of our guests and crew and may lead to fines, penalties and
reputational damage.
• The loss of key team members, our inability to recruit or retain qualified shoreside and shipboard team
members and increased labor costs could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
--- PAGE 3 END ---
• Increases in fuel prices, changes in the types of fuel consumed and availability of fuel supply may
adversely impact our scheduled itineraries and costs.
• We rely on suppliers who are integral to the operations of our businesses. These suppliers and service
providers may be unable to deliver on their commitments, which could negatively impact our business.
• Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial results.
• Overcapacity and competition in the cruise and land-based vacation industry may negatively impact our
cruise sales, pricing and destination options.
• Inability to implement our shipbuilding programs and ship repairs, maintenance and refurbishments may
adversely impact our business operations and the satisfaction of our guests.
• We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to
generate cash depends on many factors, including those beyond our control, and we may not be able to
generate cash required to service our debt and sustain our operations.
• Our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and operating flexibility.
The ordering of the risk factors set forth above is not intended to reflect our indication of priority or
likelihood. Additionally, many of these risks and uncertainties are currently, and in the future may continue
to be, amplified by our substantial debt balance incurred during the pause of our guest cruise operations.
There may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown.
Forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. Subject to any
continuing obligations under applicable law or any relevant stock exchange rules, we expressly disclaim any
obligation to disseminate, after the date of this document, any updates or revisions to any such forward-
looking statements to reflect any change in expectations or events, conditions or circumstances on which
any such statements are based.
Forward-looking and other statements in this document may also address our sustainability progress, plans,
and goals (including climate change- and environmental-related matters). In addition, historical, current,
and forward-looking sustainability- and climate-related statements may be based on standards and tools for
measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and
assumptions and predictions that are subject to change in the future and may not be generally shared.
Adjusted ROIC provides additional information to us and investors about our operating performance relative
to the capital we have invested in the company. We define adjusted ROIC as the twelve-month adjusted net
income (loss) before interest expense and interest income divided by the monthly average of debt plus equity
minus construction-in-progress, excess cash, goodwill and intangibles.

COMPANY
Carnival Corporation & plc is the largest global cruise company, and among the largest leisure travel
companies, with a portfolio of world-class cruise lines — AIDA Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises,
Cunard, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises (Australia), P&O Cruises (UK), Princess Cruises, and
Seabourn.
During 2024, we announced that we will sunset the P&O Cruises (Australia) brand and fold its Australia
operations into Carnival Cruise Line in March 2025.
Purpose & Mission
To deliver unforgettable happiness to our guests by providing extraordinary cruise vacations, while honoring
the integrity of every ocean we sail, place we visit and life we touch.
Vision
As the global leader in the cruise industry, we will lead the way in innovative and sustainable cruising to
deliver memorable vacations and build borderless connections.
2024 Executive Overview
We had a strong year, setting records and achieving milestones, including:
• Full year revenues hit an all-time high of $25 billion, over 15 percent higher than the prior year
• Seven consecutive quarters of record revenues
• Record full year operating income of $3.6 billion, over 80 percent higher than the prior year
• All-time high cash from operations of almost $6 billion
• Higher ticket prices for 2024 versus 2023 for all of our major cruise lines and onboard spending
levels that accelerated sequentially each quarter throughout the year
• Record booking trends and record year-end customer deposits, indicating a continuation of the
strong momentum we’ve been experiencing for the last two years
We remain laser focused on further reducing interest expense and rebuilding our investment-grade balance
sheet. During 2024, we made debt prepayments of over $3 billion, bringing our total prepayments to over
$7 billion since the beginning of 2023. Additionally, we have reduced our debt balance by over $8 billion
from the peak in January 2023, ending the year with $27.5 billion of debt.
We are delivering long-term value for our shareholders through improved operational execution across our
cruise lines. We ended 2024 with adjusted return on invested capital (“ROIC”) comfortably above our cost of
capital.
We welcomed three new ships during 2024:Carnival Jubilee,the third of five Excel class vessels for Carnival
Cruise Line;Sun Princess,Princess Cruises’ next generation flagship which was just awarded Conde Nast
Traveler’s 2024 Mega Ship of the year in the U.S.; andQueen Anne,Cunard’s first new ship in 14 years.
We have also been focusing on each of our cruise lines’ unique target markets, launching new marketing
campaigns across all our brands. In 2024, both new-to-cruise and repeat guests were each up double-
digit percentages and we continue to attract new cruise guests as we work to increase awareness and
consideration for cruise travel globally.
We continue to advance our enhanced destination strategy to provide guests with yet another reason to take
a cruise vacation with us. Celebration Key, our new exclusive cruise port destination on Grand Bahama
Island, is scheduled to open in the summer of 2025, with an additional pier opening in the fall of 2026. Its
five portals built for fun will further expand our experience offerings with an abundance of features and
amenities for our guests. Celebration Key will be our largest and closest destination in our portfolio,
saving fuel costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, we recently announced plans to enhance
Half Moon Cay, our highly rated and award-winning exclusive Bahamian destination. The enhancements
will lean further into this destination’s natural beauty and pristine appeal, reinforcing its new name —
1
--- PAGE 5 END ---
RelaxAway, Half Moon Cay. Featuring a newly constructed pier that is expected to be ready in the summer
of 2026, the destination will allow two ships to dock, including Carnival Cruise Line’s largest ships that will be
able to visit for the first time. We believe developing and promoting these unique assets will help us cast the
net wider and capture even more new-to-cruise demand.
During 2024, we also continued making progress towards our sustainability goals. We reduced our greenhouse
gas emission intensity by approximately 17.5 percent compared to 2019, on track to achieve our targeted
reduction of 20 percent by the end of 2026, a goal that was previously pulled forward by four years. We have
also lowered our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by almost 10 percent since 2019, despite capacity
growth of over nine percent over the same period.
We are grateful for the efforts of our hard working and dedicated team who delivered a step change
improvement in 2024 and set us up very well for 2025 and beyond, while consistently delivering unforgettable
happiness to over 13 and a half million people in 2024, by providing them with extraordinary cruise
vacations while honoring the integrity of every ocean we sail, place we visit and life we touch.

CARNIV AL CORPORATION & PLC
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — General
Description of Business
Carnival Corporation was incorporated in Panama in 1974 and Carnival plc was incorporated in England
and Wales in 2000. Together with their consolidated subsidiaries, they are referred to collectively in these
consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this 2024 Annual Report as “Carnival Corporation & plc,”
“our,” “us” and “we.” The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Carnival Corporation
and Carnival plc and their respective subsidiaries.
We are the largest global cruise company, and among the largest leisure travel companies, with a portfolio of
world-class cruise lines — AIDA Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard, Holland America
Line, P&O Cruises (Australia), P&O Cruises (UK), Princess Cruises, and Seabourn.
In June 2024, we announced that we will sunset the P&O Cruises (Australia) brand and fold its Australia
operations into Carnival Cruise Line in March 2025.
DLC Arrangement
Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc operate a dual listed company (“DLC”) arrangement, whereby the
businesses of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are combined through a number of contracts and
provisions in Carnival Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and Carnival plc’s Articles
of Association. The two companies operate as a single economic enterprise with a single senior management
team and identical Boards of Directors, but each has retained its separate legal identity. Carnival
Corporation’s shares of common stock are publicly traded on the New Y ork Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
and Carnival plc’s ordinary shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. The Carnival plc
American Depositary Shares are traded on the NYSE.
The constitutional documents of each company provide that, on most matters, the holders of the common
equity of both companies effectively vote as a single body. The Equalization and Governance Agreement
between Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc provides for the equalization of dividends and liquidation
distributions based on an equalization ratio and contains provisions relating to the governance of the DLC
arrangement. Because the equalization ratio is 1 to 1, one share of Carnival Corporation common stock
and one Carnival plc ordinary share are generally entitled to the same distributions.
Under deeds of guarantee executed in connection with the DLC arrangement, as well as stand-alone
guarantees executed since that time, each of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc have effectively cross
guaranteed all indebtedness and certain other monetary obligations of each other. Once the written demand
is made, the holders of indebtedness or other obligations may immediately commence an action against
the relevant guarantor.
Under the terms of the DLC arrangement, Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are permitted to transfer
assets between the companies, make loans to or investments in each other and otherwise enter into
intercompany transactions. In addition, the cash flows and assets of one company are required to be used
to pay the obligations of the other company, if necessary.
Given the DLC arrangement, we believe that providing separate financial statements for each of Carnival
Corporation and Carnival plc would not present a true and fair view of the economic realities of their
operations. Accordingly, separate financial statements for Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc have not
been presented.
NOTE 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
We consolidate entities over which we have control, as typically evidenced by a voting control of greater
than 50% or for which we are the primary beneficiary, whereby we have the power to direct the most
8
--- PAGE 12 END ---
significant activities and the obligation to absorb significant losses or receive significant benefits from the
entity. We do not separately present our noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements since
the amounts are immaterial. For affiliates we do not control but where significant influence over financial
and operating policies exists, as typically evidenced by a voting control of 20% to 50%, the investment is
accounted for using the equity method.
For 2023, we reclassified $11 million from restricted cash to prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets to conform to the current year presentation.
Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. We
have made reasonable estimates and judgments of such items within our consolidated financial statements
and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods. Actual results may differ from the estimates
used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. All material intercompany balances and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include investments with maturities of three months or less at acquisition which
are stated at cost and present insignificant risk of changes in value.
Trade and Other Receivables
Although we generally require full payment from our customers prior to or concurrently with their cruise,
we grant credit terms to a relatively small portion of our revenue source. We have receivables from credit card
merchants and travel agents for cruise ticket purchases and onboard revenue. These receivables are included
within trade and other receivables, net and are less allowances for expected credit losses.
Inventories
Inventories consist substantially of food, beverages, hotel supplies, fuel and retail merchandise, which are all
carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted-average or first-
in, first-out methods and applied consistently between major categories of inventory.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment charges. We
capitalize interest as part of the cost of capital projects incurred during construction. Depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over our estimated useful lives of the assets to a residual value, as a percentage
of original cost, as follows:
Years
Residual
Values
Ships .................................. 3 0 1 5 %
Ship improvements ........................ 3-30 0%
Buildings and improvements.................. 10-40 0%

The cost of ships under construction includes progress payments for the construction of new ships, as well
as design and engineering fees, capitalized interest, construction oversight costs and various owner supplied
items. Any liquidated damages received from shipyards are recorded as reductions to the cost basis of the
ship.

--- PAGE 13 END ---
We have a capital program for the improvement of our ships and for asset replacements to enhance the
effectiveness and efficiency of our operations; to comply with, or exceed, all relevant legal and statutory
requirements related to health, environment, safety, security and sustainability; and to gain strategic benefits
or provide improved product innovations to our guests. We account for ship improvement costs, including
replacements of certain significant components and parts, by capitalizing those costs we believe add value to
our ships and have a useful life greater than one year and depreciating those improvements over their
estimated remaining useful life. The costs of repairs and maintenance, including those incurred when a ship
is taken out-of-service for scheduled maintenance, and minor improvement costs and expenses, are charged
to expense as incurred.
In addition, specifically identified or estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of previously capitalized
ship components are written-off upon retirement, which may result in a loss on disposal that is also
included in other operating expenses.
We have estimated our ships’ useful lives at 30 years and residual values at 15% of our original ship cost.
Our ships’ useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the estimated weighted-average
useful lives of the ships’ major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and
cabins. We also take into consideration the impact of technological changes, historical useful lives of similarly-
built ships, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and regulatory changes, including those
related to the environment and climate change. We determine the residual value of our ships based on our
long-term estimates of their resale value at the end of their useful lives to us but before the end of their physical
and economic lives to others, historical resale values of our and other cruise ships as well as our expectations
of the long-term viability of the secondary cruise ship market. We review estimated useful lives and
residual values for reasonableness whenever events or circumstances significantly change.
We evaluate ship asset impairments at the individual ship level which is the lowest level for which identifiable
cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We review our ships for
impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a ship may not be recoverable.
If estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of a ship, an impairment charge is recognized
to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.
Leases
Substantially all of our leases for which we are the lessee are operating leases of port facilities and real
estate and are included within operating lease right-of-use assets, net, long-term operating lease liabilities
and current portion of operating lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine if an
arrangement is or contains a lease at the lease inception date by evaluating whether the arrangement conveys
the right to use an identified asset and whether we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from
and have the ability to direct the use of the asset.
We have port facilities and real estate lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and in such
cases, we account for the components as a single lease component.
We do not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for any leases that have an initial term of twelve months
or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that we are reasonably certain to
exercise. For some of our port facilities and real estate lease agreements, we have the option to extend our
current lease term by 1 to 10 years. Generally, we do not include renewal options as a component of our
present value calculation as we are not reasonably certain that we will exercise the options.
As our leases do not have a readily determinable implicit rate, we estimate the incremental borrowing rate
(“IBR”) to determine the present value of lease payments. We apply judgment in determining the IBR
including considering the term of the lease, the currency in which the lease is denominated, and the impact
of collateral and our credit risk on the rate.
We recognize lease expense for our operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in
a business acquisition. We review our goodwill for impairment as of July 31 every year, or more frequently
10
--- PAGE 14 END ---
if events or circumstances dictate. All of our goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units. The
impairment review for goodwill allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary
to perform a more detailed quantitative goodwill impairment test. We would perform the quantitative test
if our qualitative assessment determined it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit’s estimated fair value
is less than its carrying amount. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed
directly to the quantitative test for any reporting unit. When performing the quantitative test, if the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis is required. However, if the
estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, goodwill is written down based on
the difference between the reporting unit’s carrying amount and its fair value, limited to the amount of
goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Judgment is required in estimating the fair value of our reporting
unit.
Trademarks represent substantially all of our other intangibles. Trademarks are estimated to have an
indefinite useful life and are not amortizable but are reviewed for impairment at least annually and as events
or circumstances dictate. The impairment review for trademarks also allows us to first assess qualitative
factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative trademark impairment
test. We would perform the quantitative test if our qualitative assessment determined it was more-likely-than-
not that the trademarks are impaired. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed
directly to the quantitative test. Our trademarks would be considered impaired if their carrying value exceeds
their estimated fair value.
Emission Allowances
We became subject to the EU Emissions Trading System (“ETS”) on January 1, 2024, which includes a three-
year phase-in period. The ETS regulates emissions through a “cap and trade” principle, where a cap is set
on the total amount of certain emissions that can be emitted and requires us to procure emission allowances
for certain emissions inside EU waters (as defined in the ETS). Emission allowances are recorded at cost
and are included in prepaid expenses and other or other assets. Purchases of emission allowances are classified
as operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Emission obligations are recorded
when generated and are included in accrued liabilities and other and other long-term liabilities. The funded
portion of the emission obligations are measured at the carrying value of the emission allowances and the
unfunded portion of emission obligations is measured at the fair value of emission allowances necessary to
settle. We record expense for emissions in EU waters in fuel expense in the period incurred. Emission
allowances and obligations are derecognized when surrendered based on the first-in, first-out method, and
are non-cash activities.
Equity Method Investments
Equity method investments are initially recognized at cost and are included in other assets in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Our proportionate interest in their results is included in other income (expense), net in the
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).
Debt and Debt Issuance Costs
Debt is recorded at initial fair value, which normally reflects the proceeds received by us, net of debt
issuance costs. Debt is subsequently stated at amortized cost. Debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums
are generally amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective
interest method, over the term of the debt. Debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are
presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt
liability, consistent with debt discounts. For our revolving facility, and those export credit facilities not yet
drawn, the related debt issuance costs are deferred and recorded as an asset. Debt instruments are evaluated
for the existence of features that require separation and accounting as a derivative. In our Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, debt issuance costs paid to lenders related to a recognized debt liability are
netted against the proceeds from the related long-term debt while debt issuance costs paid to third parties,
or related to undrawn credit facilities, are presented separately within financing activities.
11
--- PAGE 15 END ---
Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments
We have in the past and may in the future utilize derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, such as
foreign currency forwards, options and swaps, foreign currency debt obligations and foreign currency cash
balances, to manage our exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates. We use interest
rate swaps primarily to manage our interest rate exposure to achieve a desired proportion of fixed and
floating rate debt. Our policy is to not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
All derivatives are recorded at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, then the change in
the fair value of the derivative is recognized as a component of AOCI until the underlying hedged item is
recognized in earnings or the forecasted transaction is no longer probable. If a derivative or a non-derivative
financial instrument is designated as a hedge of our net investment in a foreign operation, then changes in
the effective portion of the fair value of the financial instrument are recognized as a component of AOCI to
offset the change in the translated value of the designated portion of net investment being hedged until the
investment is sold or substantially liquidated, while the impact attributable to components excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in interest expense, net of capitalized interest, on a systematic
and rational basis. For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the change in fair value
is recognized in earnings.
We classify the fair value of all our derivative contracts as either current or long-term, depending on the
maturity date of the derivative contract. The cash flows from derivatives treated as cash flow hedges are
classified in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same category as the item being hedged.
Derivative valuations are based on observable inputs such as interest rates and commodity price curves,
forward currency exchange rates, credit spreads, maturity dates, volatilities, and cross currency basis spreads.
We use the income approach to value derivatives for foreign currency options and forwards, interest rate
swaps and cross currency swaps using observable market data for all significant inputs and standard valuation
techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount, assuming that participants are
motivated but not compelled to transact.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
These consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Each foreign entity determines its
functional currency by reference to its primary economic environment. Our most significant foreign entities
utilize the U.S. dollar, Euro, Sterling or the Australian dollar as their functional currencies. We translate
the assets and liabilities of our foreign entities that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar at
exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses of these foreign entities are translated
at the average rate for the period. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting foreign currency
translation adjustments are included as a component of AOCI, which is a separate component of
shareholders’ equity. Therefore, the U.S. dollar value of the non-equity translated items in our consolidated
financial statements will fluctuate from period to period, depending on the changing value of the U.S.
dollar versus these currencies.
We execute transactions in a number of different currencies. At the date that the transaction is recognized,
each asset, liability, revenue, expense, gain or loss arising from the transaction is measured and recorded in the
functional currency of the recording entity using the exchange rate in effect at that date. At each balance
sheet date, recorded monetary balances denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are
adjusted using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date, with gains or losses recorded in other income or
other expense, unless such monetary balances have been designated as hedges of net investments in our foreign
entities. The net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were not material in 2024,
2023 and 2022. In addition, the unrealized gains or losses on our long-term intercompany receivables and
payables which are denominated in a non-functional currency and which are not expected to be repaid in the
foreseeable future are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments included as a component of
AOCI.
Revenue and Expense Recognition
Guest cruise deposits and advance onboard purchases are initially included in customer deposits when
received. Customer deposits are subsequently recognized as cruise revenues, together with revenues from
12
--- PAGE 16 END ---
onboard and other activities, and all associated direct costs and expenses of a voyage are recognized as
cruise costs and expenses, upon completion of voyages with durations of ten nights or less and on a pro rata
basis for voyages in excess of ten nights. The impact of recognizing these shorter duration cruise revenues
and costs and expenses on a completed voyage basis versus on a pro rata basis is not material. Certain of our
product offerings are bundled and we allocate the value of the bundled services and goods between
passenger ticket revenues and onboard and other revenues based upon the estimated standalone selling
prices of those goods and services. Future travel discount vouchers are included as a reduction of cruise
passenger ticket revenues when such vouchers are utilized. Guest cancellation fees, when applicable, are
recognized in passenger ticket revenues at the time of cancellation.
Our sales to guests of air and other transportation to and from airports near the home ports of our ships
are included in passenger ticket revenues, and the related costs of these services are included in prepaid
expenses and other when paid prior to the start of a voyage and are subsequently recognized in transportation
costs at the time of revenue recognition. The cost of prepaid air and other transportation costs at
November 30, 2024 was $219 million. The proceeds that we collect from the sales of third-party shore
excursions are included in onboard and other revenues and the related costs are included in onboard and
other costs. The amounts collected on behalf of our onboard concessionaires, net of the amounts remitted
to them, are included in onboard and other revenues as concession revenues. All of these amounts are
recognized on a completed voyage or pro rata basis as discussed above.
Fees, taxes and charges that vary with guest head counts are expensed in commissions, transportation and
other costs when the corresponding revenues are recognized. The remaining portion of fees, taxes and charges
are expensed in other operating expenses when the corresponding revenues are recognized.
Revenues and expenses from our hotel and transportation operations, which are included in our Tour and
Other segment, are recognized at the time the services are performed.
Customer Deposits
Our payment terms generally require an initial deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior
to the voyage. Cash received from guests in advance of the cruise is recorded in customer deposits and in other
long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts include refundable deposits. We
had total customer deposits of $6.8 billion and $6.4 billion as of November 30, 2024 and 2023, which includes
approximately $25 million of unredeemed Future Cruise Credits (“FCCs”) as of November 30, 2024. At
November 30, 2023, we had approximately $134 million of unredeemed FCCs, of which $111 million were
refundable. During 2024 and 2023, we recognized revenues of $5.5 billion and $4.1 billion related to our
customer deposits as of November 30, 2023 and 2022. Our customer deposits balance changes due to the
seasonal nature of cash collections, which typically results from higher ticket prices and occupancy levels
during the third quarter, the recognition of revenue, refunds of customer deposits and foreign currency
changes.
Contract Costs
We recognize incremental travel agent commissions and credit and debit card fees incurred as a result of
obtaining the ticket contract as assets when paid prior to the start of a voyage. We record these amounts
within prepaid expenses and other and subsequently recognize these amounts as commissions, transportation
and other at the time of revenue recognition or at the time of voyage cancellation. We had incremental
costs of obtaining contracts with customers recognized as assets of $336 million and $294 million as of
November 30, 2024 and 2023.
Insurance
We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to cover a number of risks including illness and
injury to crew, guest injuries, pollution, other third-party claims in connection with our cruise activities,
damage to hull and machinery for each of our ships, war risks, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’
liability, property damage and general liability for shoreside third-party claims. We recognize insurance
recoverables from third-party insurers up to the amount of recorded losses at the time the recovery is probable
and upon settlement for amounts in excess of the recorded losses. All of our insurance policies are subject
13
--- PAGE 17 END ---
to coverage limits, exclusions and deductible levels. The liabilities associated with crew illnesses and crew
and guest injury claims, including all legal costs, are estimated based on the specific merits of the individual
claims or actuarially estimated based on historical claims experience, loss development factors and other
assumptions.
Selling and Administrative Expenses
Selling expenses include a broad range of advertising, marketing and promotional expenses. Advertising is
charged to expense as incurred, except for media production costs, which are expensed upon the first airing of
the advertisement. Selling expenses totaled $925 million in 2024, $851 million in 2023 and $744 million in
2022. Administrative expenses represent the costs of our shoreside support, reservations and other
administrative functions, and include salaries and related benefits, professional fees and building occupancy
costs, which are typically expensed as incurred.
Share-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards using the fair value method.
For time-based share awards, we recognize compensation cost ratably using the straight-line attribution
method over the expected vesting period or to the retirement eligibility date, if earlier than the vesting
period. For performance-based share awards, we estimate compensation cost based on the probability of
the performance condition being achieved and recognize expense ratably using the straight-line attribution
method over the expected vesting period. If all or a portion of the performance condition is not expected to
be met, the appropriate amount of previously recognized compensation expense is reversed and future
compensation expense is adjusted accordingly. We account for forfeitures as they occur.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of
shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
the weighted-average number of shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during each period
including the dilutive effect of convertible notes using the if-converted method. For earnings per share
purposes, Carnival Corporation common stock and Carnival plc ordinary shares are considered a single class
of shares since they have equivalent rights.
Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance,Liabilities-
Supplier Finance Programs — Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.This guidance requires
that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user
of financial statements to understand the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from
period to period, and potential magnitude. On December 1, 2023, we adopted this guidance using the
retrospective method for each period presented. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance,Segment Reporting — Improvements to Reportable Segment
Disclosures. This guidance requires annual and interim disclosure of significant segment expenses that are
provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) as well as interim disclosures for all reportable
segments’ profit or loss and assets. This guidance also requires disclosure of the title and position of the
CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss in
assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. This guidance is required to be
adopted by us in 2025. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance,Income Taxes — Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.
This guidance requires disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction,
as well as other amendments relating to income tax disclosures. This guidance is required to be adopted by
us in 2026. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.
14
--- PAGE 18 END ---
In November 2024, the FASB issued guidance,Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income —
Expense Disaggregation Disclosures — Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.This guidance requires
annual and interim disclosure of disaggregated information for certain costs and expenses. This guidance
is required to be adopted by us in 2028. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued guidance,Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options — Induced
Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments.This guidance clarifies the requirements for determining whether
certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as induced conversions or
extinguishments. This guidance is required to be adopted by us in 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact
this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 4 — Equity Method Investments
At November 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a 49% and 40% noncontrolling interest in Grand Bahama
Shipyard Ltd. (“Grand Bahama”), a ship repair and maintenance facility. During 2024, we acquired an
additional 9% ownership interest in Grand Bahama. As of November 30, 2024, our investment in Grand
Bahama was $45 million, consisting of $28 million in equity and a loan of $18 million. As of November 30,
2023, our investment in Grand Bahama was $43 million, consisting of $25 million in equity and a loan of
$18 million. Grand Bahama provided an immaterial amount of services to us in 2024, 2023 and 2022.
We have a 50% noncontrolling interest in Floating Docks S. de RL. (“Floating Docks”), an entity that will
purchase two floating drydocks and will then lease them to Grand Bahama. As of November 30, 2024 and
2023 our investment in Floating Docks was $81 million and $21 million. We have provided payment
guarantees on behalf of Floating Docks. As of November 30, 2024 and 2023, the amounts outstanding
under these guarantees were $37 million and $46 million.
In November 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell one-third of our interest in Grand Bahama and
Floating Docks. The closing is subject to government approval. If approved, the sale will not have a material
impact to our consolidated financial statements.
We have a 45% noncontrolling interest in the White Pass & Yukon Route (“White Pass”) that includes port,
railroad and retail operations in Skagway, Alaska. White Pass provided an immaterial amount of services
15
--- PAGE 19 END ---
to us in 2024, 2023 and 2022. In 2022, we evaluated whether our investment in White Pass was other than
temporarily impaired and performed an impairment assessment. As a result of our assessment, we recognized
impairment charges for 2022 of $30 million in other income (expense), net. As of November 30, 2024, our
investment in White Pass was $58 million, consisting of $26 million in equity and a loan of $32 million. As of
November 30, 2023, our investment in White Pass was $53 million, consisting of $21 million in equity and
a loan of $32 million.
During 2023, we completed the exit of our noncontrolling interest in Adora Cruises Limited, formerly
CSSC Carnival Cruise Shipping Limited, a China-based cruise company (“Adora Cruises”), and recognized
losses on exit of $21 million within other income (expense).
Our proportionate interest in the results of our equity method investments is not material.

As of November 30, 2024, Carnival Holdings II had $2.9 billion available for borrowing under the Revolving
Facility. Carnival Holdings II may continue to borrow or otherwise utilize available amounts under the
Revolving Facility through August 2027, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in the facility.
Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate of term SOFR, in relation to any loan in
U.S. dollars, EURIBOR, in relation to any loan in euros, or daily compounding SONIA, in relation to any
loan in sterling, plus a margin based on the long-term credit ratings of Carnival Corporation. This facility also
includes an emissions linked margin adjustment whereby, after the initial applicable margin is set per the
margin pricing grid, the margin may be adjusted based on performance in achieving certain agreed annual
GHG emissions goals. In addition, we are required to pay certain fees on the aggregate unused commitments
under the Revolving Facility.
During 2023, in connection with the Revolving Facility, Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc contributed
three unencumbered vessels with a net book value of $2.9 billion on the date of contribution (the
“Revolving Facility Subject Vessels”) to Carnival Holdings II with each of the vessels continuing to be
operated under one of the Carnival Corporation & plc brands.

Repricing of Senior Secured Term Loans
During 2024, we entered into amendments with the lender syndicate to reprice $1.7 billion of our first-
priority senior secured term loan facility maturing in 2028 and $1.0 billion of our first-priority senior secured
term loan facility maturing in 2027, which are included within the total Secured Subsidiary Guaranteed
Loans balance in the debt table above. Subsequent to November 30, 2024, we entered into further amendments
with the lender syndicate to reprice the outstanding principal amounts under these facilities (“Repriced
Loans”). The Repriced Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to SOFR with a 0.75% floor, plus a
margin equal to 2.0%.
2030 Senior Unsecured Notes
During 2024, we issued $535 million aggregate principal amount of 5.8% senior unsecured euro notes due
2030. We used the net proceeds from the issuance, together with cash on hand, to redeem the outstanding
principal amount of the 7.6% senior unsecured euro notes due 2026.
Debt Prepayments
During 2024, we made prepayments for the following debt instruments:
• Euro-denominated tranche of our first-priority senior secured term loan facility maturing in 2025
• First-priority senior secured term loan facilities maturing in 2027 and 2028
• 9.9% second-priority secured notes due 2027
• 7.6% senior unsecured euro notes due 2026
• 5.8% senior unsecured notes due 2027
• Euro floating rate loan due 2026
The aggregate amount of these prepayments was $3.8 billion.
Export Credit Facility Borrowings
During 2024, we borrowed $2.4 billion under export credit facilities due in semi-annual installments
through 2037. As of November 30, 2024, we had $7.8 billion of undrawn export credit facilities to fund ship
deliveries planned through 2033. As of November 30, 2024, the net book value of the vessels, excluding
ships under construction, subject to negative pledges pursuant to export credit facilities was $18.5 billion.
Convertible Notes
On July 1, 2024, our 5.8% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 Convertible Notes”) became
convertible, at the option of the holders, at any time prior to the close of business on September 27, 2024.
Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 2024 Convertible Notes, we irrevocably elected to settle
conversions of the 2024 Convertible Notes during this period in shares of Carnival Corporation common
stock. Substantially all of the 2024 Convertible Notes were converted to shares of common stock, which
resulted in the issuance of approximately 41.5 million shares of common stock, and the remaining principal
balance was repaid at maturity on October 1, 2024.
In November 2022, we issued $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.8% convertible senior notes due
2027 (the “2027 Convertible Notes” and, together with the 2024 Convertible Notes, the “Convertible Notes”).
The 2027 Convertible Notes mature on December 1, 2027, unless earlier repurchased or redeemed by us or
earlier converted in accordance with their terms prior to the maturity date.
The 2027 Convertible Notes are convertible by holders, subject to the conditions described within the
indenture governing the 2027 Convertible Notes, into cash, shares of Carnival Corporation common stock,
or a combination thereof, at our election. The 2027 Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of
approximately 75 shares of Carnival Corporation common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes,
equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $13.39 per share of common stock. The initial
conversion price of the 2027 Convertible Notes is subject to certain anti-dilutive adjustments and may also
increase if such 2027 Convertible Notes are converted in connection with a tax redemption or certain corporate
19
--- PAGE 23 END ---
events as described within the indenture governing the 2027 Convertible Notes. Effective December 1, 2024,
the 2027 Convertible Notes became convertible for the period beginning December 1, 2024 and ending
February 28, 2025. Refer to Note 15 — “Supplemental Cash Flow Information” for additional detail on
transactions related to the 2027 Convertible Notes.
We may redeem the 2027 Convertible Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time on or prior to the 40th
scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, if we or any guarantor
would have to pay any additional amounts on the 2027 Convertible Notes due to a change in tax laws,
regulations or rulings or a change in the official application, administration or interpretation thereof.
On or after December 5, 2025 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the
maturity date, we may redeem for cash all or part of the 2027 Convertible Notes, at our option, if the last
reported sale price of Carnival Corporation’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price then in
effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding
the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending
on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption.
The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Convertible Notes being
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The net carrying value of the Convertible Notes was as follows:
November 30,
(in millions) 2024 2023
Principal ................................................... $ 1,131 $ 1,557
Less: Unamortized debt discount and debt issue costs.................... (19) (27)

Contractual interest expense................................ $ 8 6 $ 9 1 $ 3 2
Amortization of debt discount and debt issue costs................ 8 9 2 9
$9 4 $ 1 0 0 $6 1
As of November 30, 2024, the if-converted value above par was $1.0 billion on 84.5 million available shares
for the 2027 Convertible Notes.
Collateral and Priority Pool
As of November 30, 2024, the net book value of our ships and ship improvements, excluding ships under
construction, is $39.3 billion. Our secured debt is secured on a first-priority basis by certain collateral, which
includes vessels and certain assets related to those vessels and material intellectual property (combined net
book value of approximately $22.4 billion, including $20.8 billion related to vessels and certain assets related
to those vessels) as of November 30, 2024 and certain other assets.
As of November 30, 2024, $8.0 billion in net book value of our ships and ship improvements relate to the
priority pool vessels included in the priority pool of 12 unencumbered vessels (the “Senior Priority Notes
Subject Vessels”) for our 2028 Senior Priority Notes and $2.8 billion in net book value of our ship and ship
improvements relate to the priority pool vessels included in the priority pool of the three Revolving
Facility Subject Vessels for our Revolving Facility. As of November 30, 2024, there was no change in the
identity of the Senior Priority Notes Subject Vessels or the Revolving Facility Subject Vessels.
20
--- PAGE 24 END ---
Covenant Compliance
As of November 30, 2024, our Revolving Facility, unsecured loans and export credit facilities contain
certain covenants listed below:
• Maintain minimum interest coverage (adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net interest charges, as
defined in the agreements) at a ratio of not less than 2.0 to 1.0 for each testing date occurring from
November 30, 2024 until May 31, 2025, at a ratio of not less than 2.5 to 1.0 for the August 31, 2025 and
November 30, 2025 testing dates, and at a ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0 for the February 28, 2026
testing date onwards and as applicable through their respective maturity dates
• For certain of our unsecured loans and export credit facilities, maintain minimum issued capital and
consolidated reserves (as defined in the agreements) of $5.0 billion
• Limit our debt to capital (as defined in the agreements) percentage to a percentage not to exceed
65%
• Maintain minimum liquidity of $1.5 billion
• Adhere to certain restrictive covenants through August 2027 (subject to such covenants terminating
if we reach an investment grade credit rating in accordance with the agreement governing the Revolving
Facility)
• Limit the amounts of our secured assets as well as secured and other indebtedness
At November 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the applicable covenants under our debt agreements.
Generally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then, pursuant to cross-default and/or cross-
acceleration clauses therein, substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables
could become due, and our debt and derivative contracts could be terminated. Any financial covenant
amendment may lead to increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other
available lender protections that would be applicable.
NOTE 6 — Contingencies
Litigation
We are routinely involved in legal proceedings, claims, disputes, regulatory matters and governmental
inspections or investigations arising in the ordinary course of or incidental to our business. We have insurance
coverage for certain of these claims and actions, or any settlement of these claims and actions, and
historically the maximum amount of our liability, net of any insurance recoverables, has been limited to our
self-insurance retention levels.
We record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that
an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Legal proceedings and government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable
rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could involve substantial monetary damages.
In addition, in matters for which conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an
injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways,
precluding particular business practices or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome might result
in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
As previously disclosed, on May 2, 2019, the Havana Docks Corporation filed a lawsuit against Carnival
Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida under Title III of the Cuban
Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, also known as the Helms-Burton Act, alleging that Carnival
Corporation “trafficked” in confiscated Cuban property when certain ships docked at certain ports in
Cuba, and that this alleged “trafficking” entitles the plaintiffs to treble damages. On March 21, 2022, the
court granted summary judgment in favor of Havana Docks Corporation as to liability. On December 30,
2022, the court entered judgment against Carnival Corporation in the amount of $110 million plus $4 million
in fees and costs. We appealed. On October 22, 2024, the Court of Appeals for the 11
th Circuit reversed the
District Court’s judgment against us. The case will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings
in accordance with the decision. We believe the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.
21
--- PAGE 25 END ---
As of November 30, 2024, two purported class actions brought against us by former guests in the Federal
Court in Australia and in Italy remain pending, as previously disclosed. These actions include claims based
on a variety of theories, including negligence, gross negligence and failure to warn, physical injuries and severe
emotional distress associated with being exposed to and/or contracting COVID-19 onboard our ships. On
October 24, 2023, the court in the Australian matter held that we were liable for negligence and for breach of
consumer protection warranties as it relates to the lead plaintiff. The court ruled that the lead plaintiff was
not entitled to any pain and suffering or emotional distress damages on the negligence claim and awarded
medical costs. In relation to the consumer protection warranties claim, the court found that distress and
disappointment damages amounted to no more than the refund already provided to guests and therefore
made no further award. Further proceedings will determine the applicability of this ruling to the remaining
class participants. We continue to take actions to defend against the above claims. We believe the ultimate
outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Regulatory or Governmental Inquiries and Investigations
We have been, and may continue to be, impacted by breaches in data security and lapses in data privacy,
which occur from time to time. These can vary in scope and range from inadvertent events to malicious
motivated attacks.
We have incurred legal and other costs in connection with cyber incidents that have impacted us. The
penalties and settlements paid in connection with cyber incidents over the last three years were not material.
While these incidents did not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
position or liquidity, no assurances can be given about the future and we may be subject to future attacks,
incidents or litigation that could have such a material adverse effect.
On March 14, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency notified
us of potential civil penalties and injunctive relief for alleged Clean Water Act violations by owned and
operated vessels covered by the 2013 Vessel General Permit. We are working with these agencies to reach a
resolution of this matter. We believe the ultimate outcome will not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
Under the European Union Treaty, certain economic benefits that are provided under Italian law are subject
to approval on a periodic basis by the European Commission, with the most recent approval granted
through December 31, 2023. One of our subsidiaries continues to receive and recognize these benefits. The
Italian Government has requested approval for these benefits to continue to be applied after December 31,
2023. The timing of the European Commission’s decision is uncertain and could take more than a year. If
the European Commission were to deny a portion or all of the benefits, the Italian Government may be
required to retroactively disallow these benefits and seek reimbursement from us which would result in a
reversal of the recognition of such benefits, which depending on the timing of resolution, could have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Other Contingent Obligations
Some of the debt contracts we enter into include indemnification provisions obligating us to make payments
to the counterparty if certain events occur. These contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes or
changes in laws which increase the lender’s costs. There are no stated or notional amounts included in the
indemnification clauses, and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments,
if any, under these indemnification clauses.
We have agreements with a number of credit card processors that transact customer deposits related to our
cruise vacations. Certain of these agreements allow the credit card processors to request, under certain
circumstances, that we provide a capped reserve fund in cash. Although the agreements vary, these
requirements may generally be satisfied either through a withheld percentage of customer payments or
providing cash funds directly to the credit card processor.
As of November 30, 2024 we were not required to maintain any reserve funds or compensating deposits. As
of November 30, 2023, we had $844 million in reserve funds and $158 million in compensating deposits
we were required to maintain, which were included within other assets.

NOTE 7 — Ship Commitments
As of November 30, 2024, our new ship growth capital commitments were $0.9 billion, $0.4 billion, $1.3
billion, $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion and $3.2 billion for the years ending November 30, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028,
2029 and thereafter.
NOTE 8 — Taxation
A summary of our principal taxes and exemptions in the jurisdictions where our significant operations are
located is as follows:
U.S. Income Tax
We are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the business of operating cruise ships in international
transportation. We also own and operate, among other businesses, the U.S. hotel and transportation business
of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours through U.S. corporations.
Our North American cruise ship businesses and certain ship-owning subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or
business within the U.S. Depending on its itinerary, any particular ship may generate income from sources
within the U.S. We believe that our U.S. source income and the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries,
to the extent derived from, or incidental to, the international operation of a ship or ships, is exempt from U.S.
federal income and branch profit taxes.
Our domestic U.S. operations, principally the hotel and transportation business of Holland America
Princess Alaska Tours, are subject to federal and state income taxation in the U.S.
In general, under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain non-U.S. corporations (such as our
North American cruise ship businesses) are not subject to U.S. federal income tax or branch profits tax on
U.S. source income derived from, or incidental to, the international operation of a ship or ships. Applicable
U.S. Treasury regulations provide in general that a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of
Section 883 if, in relevant part, (i) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants
an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the U.S. in respect of each category of shipping income
for which an exemption is being claimed under Section 883 (an “equivalent exemption jurisdiction”) and
(ii) the foreign corporation meets a defined publicly-traded corporation stock ownership test (the “publicly-
traded test”). Subsidiaries of foreign corporations that are organized in an equivalent exemption
jurisdiction and meet the publicly-traded test also benefit from Section 883. We believe that Panama is an
equivalent exemption jurisdiction and that Carnival Corporation currently satisfies the publicly-traded test
under the regulations. Accordingly, substantially all of Carnival Corporation’s income is exempt from U.S.
federal income and branch profit taxes.
Regulations under Section 883 list certain activities that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) does not
consider to be incidental to the international operation of ships and, therefore, the income attributable to
such activities, to the extent such income is U.S. source, does not qualify for the Section 883 exemption.
Among the activities identified as not incidental are income from the sale of air transportation, transfers,
shore excursions and pre- and post-cruise land packages to the extent earned from sources within the U.S.
We believe that the U.S. source transportation income earned by Carnival plc and its subsidiaries qualifies for
exemption from U.S. federal income tax under applicable bilateral U.S. income tax treaties.
Carnival Corporation, Carnival plc and certain subsidiaries are subject to various U.S. state income taxes
generally imposed on each state’s portion of the U.S. source income subject to U.S. federal income taxes.
However, the state of Alaska imposes an income tax on its allocated portion of the total income of our
companies doing business in Alaska and certain of their subsidiaries.
UK and Australian Income Tax
Cunard, P&O Cruises (UK) and P&O Cruises (Australia) are divisions of Carnival plc and have elected to
enter the UK tonnage tax regime under a rolling ten-year term and, accordingly, reapply every year.
Companies to which the tonnage tax regime applies pay corporation taxes on profits calculated by reference
23
--- PAGE 27 END ---
to the net tonnage of qualifying ships. UK corporation tax is not chargeable under the normal UK tax rules
on these brands’ relevant shipping income. Relevant shipping income includes income from the operation
of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities.
For a company to be eligible for the regime, it must be subject to UK corporation tax and, among other
matters, operate qualifying ships that are strategically and commercially managed in the UK. Companies
within the UK tonnage tax regime are also subject to a seafarer training requirement.
Our UK non-shipping activities that do not qualify under the UK tonnage tax regime remain subject to
normal UK corporation tax.
P&O Cruises (Australia) and all of the other cruise ships operated internationally by Carnival plc for the
cruise segment of the Australian vacation region are exempt from Australian corporation tax by virtue of the
UK/Australian income tax treaty.
Italian and German Income Tax
In December 2024, the European Commission formally approved the Italian tonnage tax rules for 10 years.
In 2025, Costa and AIDA will elect to remain in the Italian tonnage tax regime through 2034. Companies to
which the tonnage tax regime applies pay corporation taxes on shipping profits calculated by reference to
the net tonnage of qualifying ships.
Our non-shipping activities that do not qualify under the Italian tonnage tax regime remain subject to
normal Italian corporation tax.
Substantially all of AIDA ’s earnings are exempt from German income taxes by virtue of the Germany/Italy
income tax treaty.
Global Minimum Tax
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) issued Model Rules for
implementation of a 15% minimum tax for multinational enterprises as part of its initiative intended to
address the tax challenges arising from globalization. Subject to certain requirements, the OECD Model Rules
provide an exclusion for international shipping income.
The implementation of these rules will affect Carnival plc and its subsidiaries beginning in fiscal 2025 and
Carnival Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries beginning in fiscal 2026. We expect Carnival plc and its
subsidiaries will be eligible for the international shipping income exclusion based on their current structure.
Carnival Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries intend to align into a single tax jurisdiction where the
international shipping income for its North American brands is also expected to qualify for this exemption.
As a result, we do not believe the application of these rules will have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
Other
In addition to or in place of income taxes, virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose taxes, fees
and other charges based on guest counts, ship tonnage, passenger capacity or some other measure.
NOTE 9 — Shareholders’ Equity
Carnival Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation authorize its Boards of Directors, at its discretion, to
issue up to 40.0 million shares of preferred stock. At November 30, 2024 and 2023, no Carnival Corporation
preferred stock or Carnival plc preference shares had been issued.
Public Equity Offerings
In August 2022, we completed a public offering of 117.5 million shares of Carnival Corporation common
stock at a price per share of $9.95, resulting in net proceeds of $1.2 billion.

NOTE 10 — Fair Value Measurements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Financial Risks
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured using inputs
in one of the following three categories:
• Level 1 measurements are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities that we have the ability to access. Valuation of these items does not entail a significant
amount of judgment
• Level 2 measurements are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or market data
other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities
• Level 3 measurements are based on unobservable data that are supported by little or no market
activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities
Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair
value. Accordingly, certain estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the
amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.

Valuation of Goodwill and Trademarks
As of July 31, 2024, we performed our annual goodwill and trademark impairment reviews and determined
there was no impairment for goodwill or trademarks.

Impairment of Ships
In 2022, we determined that two ships had net carrying values that exceeded their respective estimated
undiscounted future cash flows. We then estimated the fair value of these ships, based on their estimated
selling values, and recognized ship impairment charges of $428 million which are included in ship and other
impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). On a segment level, we recognized
$8 million for our NAA segment and $421 million for our Europe segment. The principal assumption used
in determining the fair value of these ships were the estimated sales proceeds, which are considered a Level 3
input.
We believe we have made reasonable estimates and judgments as part of our assessments. A change in the
principal judgments or estimates may result in a need to perform additional impairment reviews.

Statements” for additional discussion.

(a) We have interest rate swaps whereby we receive floating interest rate payments in exchange for making
fixed interest rate payments. These interest rate swap agreements effectively changed $11 million at
November 30, 2024 and $46 million at November 30, 2023 of EURIBOR-based floating rate euro
debt to fixed rate euro debt, and $1.0 billion at November 30, 2024 and $2.5 billion at November 30,
2023 of SOFR-based variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. In 2024, we terminated a portion of our SOFR-
based interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $1.5 billion. As of November 30, 2024 and
November 30, 2023, the EURIBOR-based interest rate swaps settle through 2025 and were not
designated as cash flow hedges; the SOFR-based interest rate swaps settle through 2027 and were
designated as cash flow hedges.
(b) At November 30, 2023, we had a cross currency swap with a notional amount of $670 million that was
designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations with euro-denominated functional
currencies. This cross currency swap was terminated in 2024.
Our derivative contracts include rights of offset with our counterparties. As of November 30, 2024 and
2023, there was no netting for our derivative assets and liabilities. The amounts that were not offset in the
balance sheet were not material.
The effect of our derivatives qualifying and designated as hedging instruments recognized in other
comprehensive income (loss) and in net income (loss) was as follows:

Financial Risks
Fuel Price Risks
We manage our exposure to fuel price risk by managing our consumption of fuel. Substantially all of our
exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships. We manage
fuel consumption through fleet optimization, energy efficiency, itinerary efficiency, and new technologies
and alternative fuels.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks
Overall Strategy
We manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through our normal operating
and financing activities, including netting certain exposures to take advantage of any natural offsets and,
when considered appropriate, through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Our
primary focus is to monitor our exposure to, and manage, the economic foreign currency exchange risks faced
by our operations and realized if we exchange one currency for another. We consider hedging certain of
our ship commitments and net investments in foreign operations. The financial impacts of our hedging
instruments generally offset the changes in the underlying exposures being hedged.
Operational Currency Risks
Our operations primarily utilize the U.S. dollar, Euro, Sterling or the Australian dollar as their functional
currencies. Our operations also have revenue and expenses denominated in non-functional currencies.
Movements in foreign currency exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements.
Investment Currency Risks
We consider our investments in foreign operations to be denominated in stable currencies and of a long-term
nature. We have euro-denominated debt which provides an economic offset for our operations with euro
functional currency. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future utilize derivative financial
instruments, such as cross currency swaps, to manage our exposure to investment currency risks.
Newbuild Currency Risks
Our shipbuilding contracts are typically denominated in euros. At November 30, 2024, our newbuild
currency exchange rate risk relates to euro-denominated newbuild contract payments for non-euro functional
currency brands. The cost of shipbuilding orders that we may place in the future that are denominated in a
different currency than our cruise brands’ functional currency will be affected by foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations. These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our decision to order new
cruise ships. We have in the past and may in the future utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign
currency derivatives, to manage our exposure to newbuild currency risks. Our decisions to hedge non-
functional currency ship commitments for our cruise brands are made on a case-by-case basis, considering
the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility, economic trends, our overall expected net cash
flows by currency and other offsetting risks.
Interest Rate Risks
We manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our debt portfolio management and
investment strategies. We evaluate our debt portfolio to determine whether to make periodic adjustments to
the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps and the issuance of new
debt.

Concentrations of Credit Risk
As part of our ongoing control procedures, we monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with
financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business. We seek to manage these credit
risk exposures, including counterparty nonperformance primarily associated with our cash and cash
equivalents, investments, notes receivables, reserve funds related to customer deposits (when required),
future financing facilities, contingent obligations, derivative instruments, insurance contracts and new ship
progress payment guarantees, by:
• Conducting business with well-established financial institutions, insurance companies and export
credit agencies
• Diversifying our counterparties
• Having guidelines regarding credit ratings and investment maturities that we follow to help safeguard
liquidity and minimize risk
• Generally requiring collateral and/or guarantees to support notes receivable on significant asset sales
and new ship progress payments to shipyards
We also monitor the creditworthiness of travel agencies and tour operators in Australia and Europe and
credit and debit card providers to which we extend credit in the normal course of our business. Our credit
exposure also includes contingent obligations related to cash payments received directly by travel agents and
tour operators for cash collected by them on cruise sales in Australia and most of Europe where we are
obligated to honor our guests’ cruise payments made by them to their travel agents and tour operators
regardless of whether we have received these payments.
Concentrations of credit risk associated with trade receivables and other receivables, charter-hire agreements
and contingent obligations are not considered to be material, principally due to the large number of
unrelated accounts, the nature of these contingent obligations and their short maturities. Normally, we have
not required collateral or other security to support normal credit sales and have not experienced significant
credit losses.
NOTE 11 — Leases
The components of expense were as follows:
November 30,
(in millions) 2024 2023 2022
Operating lease expense............................... $ 2 1 5 $ 2 1 3 $ 1 9 2
Variable lease expense (a) (b)............................ $ 2 1 1 $ 1 1 6 $ (39)
(a) Variable lease expense represents costs associated with our multi-year preferential berthing agreements
which vary based on the number of passengers. These costs are recorded within commissions,
transportation and other in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Variable lease expense
related to operating leases, other than the port facilities, were not material to our consolidated financial
statements.
(b) Several of our preferential berthing agreements have force majeure provisions which were in effect
during the pause in guest cruise operations due to COVID-19.
During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the cash outflow for leases was materially consistent with the lease expense
recognized and short-term lease costs were not material.
Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new and amended operating lease liabilities was $247 million
in 2024 and $108 million in 2023.
Weighted average of the remaining lease terms and weighted average discount rates are as follows:

Thereafter ......................................................... 9 3 1
Total lease payments................................................ 1,947
Less: Present value discount............................................. (545)
Present value of lease liabilities........................................... $ 1,402
For time charter arrangements where we are the lessor and for transactions with cruise guests related to the
use of cabins, we do not separate lease and non-lease components since (1) the lease on a standalone basis
would be classified as an operating lease and (2) the timing and pattern of transfer for the lease component
and associated non-lease component are the same. As the non-lease components are the predominant
components in the agreements, we account for these transactions under the Revenue Recognition guidance.
NOTE 12 — Segment Information

NOTE 13 — Compensation Plans and Post-Employment Benefits
Equity Plans
We issue our share-based compensation awards, which at November 30, 2024 included time-based share
awards (restricted stock awards and restricted stock units) and performance-based share awards (restricted
stock units) (collectively “equity awards”), under the Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc stock plans.
Equity awards are principally granted to management level employees and members of our Boards of
Directors. The plans are administered by the Compensation Committees which are made up of independent
directors who determine which employees are eligible to participate, the monetary value or number of
shares for which equity awards are to be granted and the amounts that may be exercised or sold within a
specified term. We had an aggregate of 26.8 million shares available for future grant at November 30, 2024.
We fulfill our equity award obligations using shares purchased in the open market or with unissued or
treasury shares. Our equity awards generally vest over a three-year period, subject to earlier vesting under
certain conditions.

Single-employer Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We maintain several single-employer defined benefit pension plans, which cover certain shipboard and
shoreside employees. The U.S. and UK shoreside employee plans are closed to new membership and are
funded at or above the level required by U.S. or UK regulations. The remaining defined benefit plans are
primarily unfunded. These plans provide pension benefits primarily based on employee compensation
and years of service.

the UK Plan’s future net periodic pension cost was determined as the equivalent rate based on applying each
individual spot rate from a yield curve determined from AA credit rated bonds at the balance sheet date
for each year’s cash flow. The UK Plan’s expected long-term return on plan assets is consistent with the
long-term investment return target provided to the UK Plan’s fiduciary manager (UK government fixed
interest bonds (gilts)) plus 1.0% and was 5.7% per annum as of November 30, 2024.

Our investment strategy for our pension plan assets is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset classes to
produce a sufficient level of diversification and investment return over the long term. The investment policy
for each plan specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the plan, asset allocation guidelines,
criteria for selection of investment managers and procedures to monitor overall investment performance, as
well as investment manager performance. As of November 30, 2024 and 2023, the All Other Plans were

Multiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We participate in two multiemployer defined benefit pension plans in the UK, the British Merchant Navy
Officers Pension Fund (registration number 10005645) (“MNOPF”), which is divided into two sections, the
“Old Section” and the “New Section,” and the British Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (registration
number 10005646) (“MNRPF”). Collectively, we refer to these as “the multiemployer plans.” The
multiemployer plans are maintained for the benefit of the employees of the participating employers who
make contributions to the plans. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from
single-employer plans, including:
• Contributions made by employers, including us, may be used to provide benefits to employees of
other participating employers
• If any of the participating employers were to withdraw from the multiemployer plans or fail to make
their required contributions, any unfunded obligations would be the responsibility of the remaining
participating employers.
34
--- PAGE 38 END ---
We are contractually obligated to make all required contributions as determined by the plans’ trustees. All
of our multiemployer plans are closed to new membership and future benefit accrual.
The MNOPF Old Section is fully funded and covered by a third-party insurer, with no further funding
obligations.
We expense our portion of the MNOPF New Section deficit as amounts are invoiced by, and become due
and payable to, the trustees. Based on the most recent triennial valuation at March 31, 2024 of the MNOPF
New Section, it was determined that this plan was 100% funded. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, our contributions
to the MNOPF New Section did not exceed 5% of total contributions to the fund.
We accrue and expense our portion of the MNRPF deficit based on our estimated probable obligation
from the most recent actuarial review. Based on the most recent triennial valuation at March 31, 2023 of the
MNRPF, it was determined that this plan was 85% funded. Our share of the deficit of $3 million was paid
in 2024. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, our contributions to the MNRPF did not exceed 5% of total contributions
to the fund.
Total expense (benefit) for the multiemployer plans was $(19) million in 2024, $1 million in 2023 and
$2 million in 2022.
Defined Contribution Plans
We have several defined contribution plans available to most of our employees. We contribute to these plans
based on employee contributions, salary levels and length of service. Total expense for these plans was
$47 million in 2024, $48 million in 2023 and $40 million in 2022.

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Our management,
with the participation of our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Climate Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework (the “COSO
Framework”). Based on this evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November 30, 2024.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated
financial statements, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
November 30, 2024 as stated in their report, which is included in this 2024 Annual Report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Boards of Directors and Shareholders of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Carnival Corporation & plc (comprising
Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc and their respective subsidiaries, the “Company”) as of November 30,
2024, the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’
equity, and cash flows, for the year ended November 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of November 30, 2024, based on criteria established inInternal Control — Integrated Framework(2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of November 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the year ended November 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of November 30, 2024, based on criteria established inInternal Control —
Integrated Framework(2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanyingManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
38
--- PAGE 42 END ---
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the
financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and
that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does
not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or
on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Debt — Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the Financial Statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company has current and long-term debt of $1.5 billion and $25.9 billion, respectively, as of
November 30, 2024. Debt is recorded at initial fair value, which normally reflects the proceeds received by
the Company, net of debt issuance costs. Debt is subsequently stated at amortized cost. Debt issuance costs,
discounts and premiums are generally amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method, which
approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the debt. Debt issuance costs related to a
recognized debt liability are presented as a direct deduction of the carrying amount of that debt, consistent
with debt discounts. Debt issuance costs related to the Company’s revolving facility and export credit
facilities not yet drawn are deferred and recorded as an asset. Debt issuance costs paid to lenders related to
a recognized debt liability are netted against the proceeds from the related debt while debt issuance costs paid
to third parties, or related to undrawn credit facilities, are presented separately within financing activities.
Debt instruments are also evaluated by the Company for the existence of features that must be separated and
accounted for as a derivative. During the year ended November 30, 2024, the Company entered into
various debt transactions that involved issuance of new debt, modification and extinguishment of existing
debt, and refinancing of existing syndicated debt.
We identified the accounting for debt and the related debt transactions, as a critical audit matter because of
the complexity involved in (i) evaluating the accounting for the refinanced debt including whether such
refinancing transactions resulted in a debt modification or extinguishment and the associated impact on
debt issuance costs, (ii) evaluating the appropriate statement of cash flows presentation for a debt transaction
that involved a syndicated loan with multiple lenders, and (iii) evaluating the existence of and accounting
for features embedded in new or amended debt agreements that must be separated and accounted for as a
derivative. This required an increased extent of effort due to the potential magnitude and complexity of the
debt transactions, including the assistance of our professionals with specialized knowledge and skills in
the relevant technical accounting guidance required when performing audit procedures to address these
matters.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the accounting for debt and related debt transactions included the following,
among others:
• We tested the effectiveness of controls over debt including those over the application of relevant
technical accounting guidance to complex and significant debt transactions.
39
--- PAGE 43 END ---
• We evaluated and tested management’s debt modification or extinguishment analysis by:
◦ Testing the accuracy and completeness, including mathematical accuracy, of management’s
analysis.
◦ Evaluating management’s analysis over whether the debt transactions met the conditions to be
treated as a debt modification or extinguishment by evaluating it against the relevant technical
accounting guidance.
• We evaluated and tested management’s analysis of the cash receipts and repayment amounts, on a
lender-by-lender basis, related to the refinancing of existing syndicated debt to assess the
appropriateness of such amounts in the statement of cash flows presentation by:
◦ Reading the terms of the debt agreements related to the syndicated loan with multiple lenders.
◦ Testing the completeness and accuracy, including mathematical accuracy, of the Company’s
lender-by-lender analysis.
◦ Evaluating management’s analysis over whether the cash receipts and repayment amounts, on a
lender-by-lender basis, met the conditions to be accounted for as a debt modification or
extinguishment.
◦ Utilizing the assistance of our professionals with specialized knowledge and skills in the relevant
technical accounting guidance we evaluated the Company’s conclusion regarding the
appropriate statement of cash flows presentation.
• We evaluated the conclusions reached by management on its analysis of the terms in the new,
amended and refinanced debt agreements to evaluate the existence of features in the new or amended
debt agreements that must be separated and accounted for as a derivative by:
◦ Reading the terms for a selection of debt agreements to evaluate the existence of features in the
new or amended debt agreements that must be separated and accounted for as a derivative.
◦ Evaluating management’s analysis identifying the existence of and accounting for the features in
the new, amended and refinanced debt agreements that must be separated and accounted for
as a derivative by evaluating it against the relevant technical accounting guidance.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Boards of Directors and Shareholders of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Carnival Corporation & plc (comprising
Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc and their respective subsidiaries, the “Company”) as of November 30,
2023, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), of comprehensive income (loss), of
shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended November 30, 2023,
including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of November 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
two years in the period ended November 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which
it accounts for convertible instruments in 2023.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those
risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
2024 Executive Overview
We had a strong year, setting records and achieving milestones, including:
• Full year revenues hit an all-time high of $25 billion, over 15 percent higher than the prior year
• Seven consecutive quarters of record revenues
• Record full year operating income of $3.6 billion, over 80 percent higher than the prior year
• All-time high cash from operations of almost $6 billion
• Higher ticket prices for 2024 versus 2023 for all of our major cruise lines and onboard spending
levels that accelerated sequentially each quarter throughout the year
• Record booking trends and record year-end customer deposits, indicating a continuation of the
strong momentum we’ve been experiencing for the last two years
We remain laser focused on further reducing interest expense and rebuilding our investment-grade balance
sheet. During 2024, we made debt prepayments of over $3 billion, bringing our total prepayments to over
$7 billion since the beginning of 2023. Additionally, we have reduced our debt balance by over $8 billion
from the peak in January 2023, ending the year with $27.5 billion of debt.
We are delivering long-term value for our shareholders through improved operational execution across our
cruise lines. We ended 2024 with adjusted return on invested capital (“ROIC”) comfortably above our cost of
capital.
We welcomed three new ships during 2024:Carnival Jubilee,the third of five Excel class vessels for Carnival
Cruise Line;Sun Princess,Princess Cruises’ next generation flagship which was just awarded Conde Nast
Traveler’s 2024 Mega Ship of the year in the U.S.; andQueen Anne,Cunard’s first new ship in 14 years.
We have also been focusing on each of our cruise lines’ unique target markets, launching new marketing
campaigns across all our brands. In 2024, both new-to-cruise and repeat guests were each up double-
digit percentages and we continue to attract new cruise guests as we work to increase awareness and
consideration for cruise travel globally.
We continue to advance our enhanced destination strategy to provide guests with yet another reason to take
a cruise vacation with us. Celebration Key, our new exclusive cruise port destination on Grand Bahama
Island, is scheduled to open in the summer of 2025, with an additional pier opening in the fall of 2026. Its
five portals built for fun will further expand our experience offerings with an abundance of features and
amenities for our guests. Celebration Key will be our largest and closest destination in our portfolio, saving
fuel costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, we recently announced plans to enhance Half
Moon Cay, our highly rated and award-winning exclusive Bahamian destination. The enhancements will
lean further into this destination’s natural beauty and pristine appeal, reinforcing its new name — RelaxAway,
Half Moon Cay. Featuring a newly constructed pier that is expected to be ready in the summer of 2026,
the destination will allow two ships to dock, including Carnival Cruise Line’s largest ships that will be able
to visit for the first time. We believe developing and promoting these unique assets will help us cast the net
wider and capture even more new-to-cruise demand.
During 2024, we also continued making progress towards our sustainability goals. We reduced our greenhouse
gas emission intensity by approximately 17.5 percent compared to 2019, on track to achieve our targeted
reduction of 20 percent by the end of 2026, a goal that was previously pulled forward by four years. We have
also lowered our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by almost 10 percent since 2019, despite capacity
growth of over nine percent over the same period.
We are grateful for the efforts of our hard working and dedicated team who delivered a step change
improvement in 2024 and set us up very well for 2025 and beyond, while consistently delivering unforgettable
happiness to over 13 and a half million people in 2024, by providing them with extraordinary cruise
vacations while honoring the integrity of every ocean we sail, place we visit and life we touch.

New Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to our consolidated financial statements for further information onAccounting Pronouncements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our critical accounting estimates are those we believe require our most significant judgments about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our critical accounting estimates, the underlying
judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates
would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions is as follows:
Ship Accounting
We make several critical accounting estimates with respect to our ship accounting including ship improvement
costs, estimated useful lives and residual values.
We account for ship improvement costs, including replacements of certain significant components and
parts, by capitalizing those costs that we believe add value to our ships and have a useful life greater than
one year and depreciating those improvements over their estimated remaining useful life. The costs of repairs
and maintenance, including those incurred when a ship is taken out-of-service for scheduled maintenance,
and minor improvement costs and expenses, are charged to expense as incurred. If we change our assumptions
in making our determinations as to whether improvements to a ship add value, the amounts we expense
each year as repair and maintenance expense could increase, which would be partially offset by a decrease in
depreciation expense, resulting from a reduction in capitalized costs.
In addition, the specifically identified or estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of previously
capitalized ship components are written-off upon retirement, which may result in a loss on disposal that is
also included in other operating expenses. We do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically
componentize our ships. In addition, since we do not separately componentize our ships, we do not identify
and track depreciation of original ship components. Therefore, we typically have to estimate the net book
value of components that are retired, based primarily upon their replacement cost, their age and their
original estimated useful lives. Given the large size and complexity of our ships, ship accounting estimates
require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain.
In order to compute our ships’ depreciation expense, we apply judgment to determine their useful lives as
well as their residual values. We have estimated our ships’ useful lives at 30 years and residual values at 15%
of our original ship cost. Our ships’ useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the
estimated weighted-average useful lives of the ships’ major component systems, such as hull, superstructure,
main electric, engines and cabins. We also take into consideration the impact of technological changes,
historical useful lives of similarly-built ships, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and regulatory
changes, including those related to the environment and climate change. We determine the residual value of
our ships based on our long-term estimates of their resale value at the end of their useful lives to us but before
the end of their physical and economic lives to others, historical resale values of our and other cruise ships
as well as our expectations of the long-term viability of the secondary cruise ship market. We review estimated
useful lives and residual values for reasonableness whenever events or circumstances significantly change.
During the pause of our guest cruise operations, we disposed of ships for amounts significantly below their
book values. Management estimates that this trend will continue to normalize in the coming years.
The IMO’s 2023 Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships (“IMO Strategy”) strives to peak
GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible and to reach net zero GHG emissions on a
well-to-wake basis by or around 2050. The IMO Strategy includes checkpoints in 2030 and 2040 that seek
reductions in the absolute GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 20% and 70%, respectively,
compared to 2008. It also includes a target of a 40% reduction in CO
2 emissions intensity by 2030 compared
to 2008. The EU has also proposed several regulations that will likely impact the cost of fossil fuels and
has recently adopted the inclusion of maritime shipping in the EU’s Emissions Trading System. We have
established Climate Action Goals, which include a GHG intensity reduction goal of 20% by 2030 from the
2019 baseline and we are pursuing our aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050. Given a 30-year estimated
useful life for our ships, our most recently delivered vessels’ lives will extend beyond this 2050 date. To
43
--- PAGE 47 END ---
provide a path to net zero emissions, alternative low GHG emission fuels will be necessary for the maritime
industry; however, there are significant supply challenges that must be resolved before viability is reached. We
are closely monitoring technology developments and partnering with organizations on research and
development to support our sustainability goals and aspirations. Our fleet’s engines are capable of being
modified for use with certain alternative fuels and we have completed tests on the use of marine biofuel blends
on certain ships in our fleet. In addition, and in support of our Climate Action Goals, we invest in
technologies, including the use of LNG powered cruise ships, the installation of Advanced Air Quality
Systems on board our ships to aid in the reduction of sulfur emissions, the use of shore power, enabling ships
to use shoreside electric power where available while in port and various other efficiency related upgrades
intended to reduce our emissions. It is uncertain how proposed and possible future regulatory changes related
to the environment and climate change and our aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050, may impact our
ships’ useful lives and residual values and the impact is dependent on future regulatory actions and
technological advances. As of November 30, 2024, management concluded that there were no changes in
our ship useful lives and residual value estimates.
If materially different conditions existed, or if we materially changed our assumptions of ship useful lives
and residual values, then our depreciation expense, loss on retirement of ship components and net book value
of our ships would be materially different. Our 2024 ship depreciation expense would have increased by
approximately:
• $51 million assuming we had reduced our estimated 30-year ship useful life estimate by one year at
the time we took delivery or acquired each of our ships
• $260 million assuming we had estimated our ships to have no residual value
We believe that the estimates we made for ship accounting purposes are reasonable and our methods are
consistently applied in all material respects and result in depreciation expense that is based on a rational and
systematic method to equitably allocate the costs of our ships to the periods during which we use them.
Valuation of Ships
We review our ships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of a ship may not be recoverable. When an impairment review is appropriate, such as an expected
sale of a ship before the end of its useful life, impairment reviews of our ships require us to make significant
estimates. We evaluate ship asset impairments at the individual ship level which is the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If estimated
future cash flows are less than the carrying value of a ship, an impairment charge is recognized to the
extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.
The estimation of a ship’s fair value includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and
uncertainties. The principal assumption used in determining the fair value of our ships tested for impairment
in 2022 was the estimated sales proceeds.
We determined the fair value of these ships based on their respective estimated selling values, for those ships
expected to be disposed of, or estimated discounted future cash flows and comparable market transactions.
Where estimated future cash flows are used to estimate the recoverable value of a ship, the cash flows include
estimated regulatory costs, including those related to proposed regulations, which are likely to impact costs
and capital expenditures, including those expected to meet our 2030 Climate Action Goals.
Refer to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our property and equipment
policy and ship impairment reviews.
We believe that we have made reasonable estimates.
Contingencies
We periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us, as well as
for other known unasserted claims, including environmental, legal, regulatory and guest and crew matters.
While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these matters, we use our
best judgment to determine the appropriate amounts to record in our consolidated financial statements.
44
--- PAGE 48 END ---
We accrue a liability and establish a reserve when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated. In assessing probable losses, we make estimates of the amount of probable
insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets where appropriate. Such accruals and reserves are
typically based on developments to date, management’s estimates of the outcomes of these matters, our
experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar matters, historical claims experience, actuarially
determined estimates of liabilities and any related insurance coverage.
Given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of these matters and potential insurance
recoveries, it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different
from any provisions or disclosures that we may have made. In addition, as new information becomes available,
we may need to reassess amounts accrued related to our contingencies. All such changes in our estimates
could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.
Refer to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of contingencies.
Known Trends and Uncertainties
• We believe the volatility in the cost of fuel is reasonably likely to continue to impact our profitability
in both the short and long-term.
• We believe the increasing global focus on climate change, including the reduction of GHG emissions
and new and evolving regulatory requirements, is reasonably likely to have a material negative impact
on our future financial results. We became subject to the EU Emissions Trading System (“ETS”) on
January 1, 2024, which includes a three-year phase-in period. Refer to XVIII. Governmental
Regulations.
Results of Operations
We have historically earned substantially all of our cruise revenues from the following:
• Sales of passenger cruise tickets and, in some cases, the sale of air and other transportation to and
from airports near our ships’ home ports and cancellation fees. The cruise ticket price typically includes
the following:
• Accommodations
• Most meals, including snacks at numerous venues
• Access to amenities such as swimming pools, water slides, water parks, whirlpools, a health club
and sun decks
• Child care and supervised youth programs
• Entertainment, such as theatrical and comedy shows, live music and nightclubs
• Visits to multiple destinations
• Sales of onboard goods and services not included in the cruise ticket price. This generally includes
the following:
• Beverage sales • Internet and communication services
• Casino gaming • Full service spas
• Shore excursions • Specialty restaurants
• Retail sales • Art sales
• Photo sales • Laundry and dry cleaning services
These goods and services are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires, from which
we receive either a percentage of their revenues or a fee. Concession revenues do not have direct expenses
because the costs and services incurred for concession revenues are borne by our concessionaires. In 2024,
we earned 34% of our cruise revenues from onboard and other revenue goods and services.
We earn our tour and other revenues from our hotel and transportation operations and other revenues.
45
--- PAGE 49 END ---
We incur cruise operating expenses for the following:
• The costs of passenger cruise bookings, which include travel agent commissions, cost of air and
other transportation, port fees, taxes, and charges that directly vary with guest head counts and credit
and debit card fees
• Onboard and other cruise costs, which include the costs of beverage sales, costs of shore excursions,
costs of retail sales, internet and communication costs, credit and debit card fees, other onboard costs,
costs of cruise vacation protection programs and pre- and post-cruise land packages
• Payroll and related costs, which include the costs of officers and crew in bridge, engineering and
hotel operations. Substantially all costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in selling
and administrative expenses
• Fuel costs, which include fuel delivery costs and European Union Allowance costs
• Food costs, which include both our guest and crew food costs
• Other ship operating expenses, which include port costs that do not vary with guest head counts;
repairs and maintenance, including minor improvements and dry-dock expenses; hotel costs;
entertainment; gains and losses on ship sales; ship impairments; freight and logistics; insurance
premiums and all other ship operating expenses
We incur tour and other costs and expenses for our hotel and transportation operations and other expenses.

Notes to Statistical Information
(a) PCD represents the number of cruise passengers on a voyage multiplied by the number of revenue-
producing ship operating days for that voyage.
(b) ALBD is a standard measure of passenger capacity for the period that we use to approximate rate and
capacity variances, based on consistently applied formulas that we use to perform analyses to
determine the main non-capacity driven factors that cause our cruise revenues and expenses to vary.
ALBDs assume that each cabin we offer for sale accommodates two passengers and is computed by
multiplying passenger capacity by revenue-producing ship operating days in the period.
(c) In 2024 compared to 2023, we had a 4.7% capacity increase in ALBDs comprised of a 7.9% capacity
increase in our NAA segment and a 0.5% capacity decrease in our Europe segment.
46
--- PAGE 50 END ---
Our NAA segment’s capacity increase was caused by the following:
• Carnival Cruise Line 4,090-passenger capacity ship that transferred from Costa Cruises and
entered into service in May 2023
• Seabourn 260-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in July 2023
• Carnival Cruise Line 5,360-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in December 2023
• Princess Cruises 4,310-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in February 2024
• Carnival Cruise Line 4,130-passenger capacity ship that transferred from Costa Cruises and
entered into service in April 2024
The increase in our NAA segment’s capacity was partially offset by a Seabourn 460-passenger capacity
ship that was removed from service in September 2024.
Our Europe segment’s capacity decrease was caused by the following:
• Costa Cruises 4,090-passenger capacity ship that transferred to Carnival Cruise Line in
March 2023
• AIDA Cruises 1,270-passenger capacity ship that was removed from service in November 2023
• Costa Cruises 4,240-passenger capacity ship that transferred to Carnival Cruise Line and was
removed from Costa Cruises’ fleet in February 2024
• The Red Sea rerouting as certain ships repositioned without guests
The decrease in our Europe segment’s capacity was partially offset by the following:
• The return to service of two ships as part of the completion of our return to guest cruise
operations
• P&O Cruises (UK) 5,280-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in December 2022
• Cunard 2,960-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in May 2024
(d) Occupancy, in accordance with cruise industry practice, is calculated using a numerator of PCDs and a
denominator of ALBDs, which assumes two passengers per cabin even though some cabins can
accommodate three or more passengers. Percentages in excess of 100% indicate that on average more
than two passengers occupied some cabins.
2024 Compared to 2023
The discussion below compares the results of operations for the year ended November 30, 2024 to the year
ended November 30, 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial

This increase was driven by:
• $142 million — 8.8 percentage point increase in occupancy
• $72 million — higher onboard spending by our guests
Costs and Expenses
Consolidated
Operating expenses increased by $1.3 billion, or 9.2%, to $15.6 billion in 2024 from $14.3 billion in 2023.

--- PAGE 52 END ---
This increase was caused by:
• $731 million — 4.7% capacity increase in ALBDs
• $333 million — higher commissions, transportation costs, and other expenses driven by higher
commission on increased ticket pricing and an increase in the number of guests
• $144 million — higher onboard and other cost of sales driven by higher onboard revenues
• $139 million — 5.1 percentage point increase in occupancy
• $63 million — higher repair and maintenance expenses (including dry-dock expenses)
• $59 million — net unfavorable foreign currency translational impact
• $47 million — decreases in gains on ship sales realized in 2024 compared to 2023
• $36 million — higher port expenses
These increases were partially offset by:
• $89 million — lower fuel consumption per ALBD
• $58 million — lower fuel prices
• $23 million — change in pension valuation
Selling and administrative expenses increased by $302 million, or 10%, to $3.3 billion in 2024 from $2.9 billion
in 2023. This increase was driven by higher compensation expense, increased investment in advertising and
higher information technology expense.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $187 million, or 7.9%, to $2.6 billion in 2024 from
$2.4 billion in 2023. This increase was driven by capacity increases, fleet enhancements and investments in
shoreside assets for our NAA segment.
NAA Segment
Operating expenses increased by $968 million, or 10%, to $10.6 billion in 2024 from $9.6 billion in 2023.
This increase was caused by:
• $753 million — 7.9% capacity increase in ALBDs
• $160 million — higher commissions, transportation costs, and other expenses driven by higher
commission on increased ticket pricing and an increase in the number of guests
• $81 million — higher onboard and other cost of sales driven by higher onboard revenues
• $76 million — higher repair and maintenance expenses (including dry-dock expenses)
• $46 million — 2.7 percentage point increase in occupancy
These increases were partially offset by:
• $86 million — lower fuel consumption per ALBD
• $50 million — lower fuel prices
Selling and administrative expenses increased by $199 million, or 11%, to $2.0 billion in 2024 from $1.8 billion
in 2023. This increase was driven by higher compensation expense, increased investment in advertising and
higher information technology expense.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $168 million, or 11%, to $1.7 billion in 2024 from
$1.5 billion in 2023.
This increase was caused by:
• $117 million — 7.9% capacity increase in ALBDs
• $51 million — fleet enhancements and investments in shoreside assets
49
--- PAGE 53 END ---
Europe Segment
Operating expenses increased by $336 million, or 7.6%, to $4.7 billion in 2024 from $4.4 billion in 2023.
This increase was caused by:
• $174 million — higher commissions, transportation costs, and other expenses driven by an increase
in the number of guests
• $92 million — 8.8 percentage point increase in occupancy
• $63 million — higher onboard and other cost of sales driven by higher onboard revenues
• $62 million — net unfavorable foreign currency translational impact
• $47 million — nonrecurrence of gains on sale of three Europe segment ships in 2023
These increases were partially offset by a $23 million change in pension valuation.
Selling and administrative expenses increased by $85 million, or 9.7%, to $961 million in 2024 from
$876 million in 2023.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $8 million, or 1.2%, to $676 million in 2024 from
$668 million in 2023.
Operating Income
Our consolidated operating income increased by $1.6 billion to $3.6 billion in 2024 from $2.0 billion in
2023. Our NAA segment’s operating income increased by $879 million to $2.6 billion in 2024 from $1.8 billion
in 2023, and our Europe segment’s operating income increased by $747 million to $1.3 billion in 2024 from
$593 million in 2023. These changes were primarily due to the reasons discussed above.
Nonoperating Income (Expense)
Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased by $311 million, or 15%, to $1.8 billion in 2024 from
$2.1 billion in 2023. The decrease was substantially all due to a decrease in total debt and lower average
interest rates.
Debt extinguishment and modification costs decreased by $32 million, or 28%, to $79 million in 2024 from
$111 million in 2023 as a result of debt transactions occurring during the respective periods.
Other income (expense), net increased by $157 million to $83 million in 2024 from ($75) million in 2023.
The increase primarily relates to a non-recurring favorable result related to litigation.
Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources
As of November 30, 2024, we had $4.2 billion of liquidity including $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents
and $2.9 billion of borrowings available under our multi-currency revolving credit facility (“Revolving
Facility”). In addition, we had $7.8 billion of undrawn export credit facilities to fund ship deliveries planned
through 2033. We will continue to pursue various opportunities to repay portions of our existing
indebtedness and refinance future debt maturities to extend maturity dates and reduce interest expense.
Refer to Note 5 — “Debt” of the consolidated financial statements and Funding Sources below for additional
details.
We had a working capital deficit of $8.2 billion as of November 30, 2024 compared to a working capital
deficit of $6.2 billion as of November 30, 2023. The increase in working capital deficit was caused by increases
in customer deposits and accrued liabilities and other and decreases in the current portion of long-term
debt, cash and cash equivalents and prepaid expenses and other. We operate with a substantial working capital
deficit. This deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that, under our business model, substantially all of our
passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date. These advance passenger
receipts generally remain a current liability on our balance sheet until the sailing date. The cash generated
from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources, such as our
borrowings and other cash from operations. The cash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund
50
--- PAGE 54 END ---
operating expenses, pay down our debt, make long-term investments or any other use of cash. Included
within our working capital are $6.4 billion and $6.1 billion of customer deposits as of November 30, 2024
and 2023. We have agreements with a number of credit card processors that transact customer deposits related
to our cruise vacations. Certain of these agreements allow the credit card processors to request, under
certain circumstances, that we provide a capped reserve fund in cash. As of November 30, 2024, we were
not required to maintain any reserve funds. In addition, we have a relatively low level of accounts receivable
and limited investment in inventories.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Operating Activities
Our business provided $5.9 billion of net cash flows from operating activities during 2024, an increase of
$1.6 billion, compared to $4.3 billion provided in 2023. This was caused by cash provided by the release of
$0.8 billion credit card reserve funds (included in the change in prepaid expenses and other assets) and our net
income position of $1.9 billion in 2024 compared to our net loss position of $74 million in 2023, partially
offset by a decrease in other working capital changes.
Investing Activities
During 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $4.5 billion. This was caused by:
• Capital expenditures of $4.6 billion primarily attributable to the delivery of two NAA segment ships,
one Europe segment ship and developments in our port destinations and exclusive islands
• Proceeds of $58 million primarily from the sale of an NAA segment ship
During 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $2.8 billion. This was driven by:
• Capital expenditures of $3.3 billion with the majority attributable to the delivery of one Europe
segment ship and one NAA segment ship
• Proceeds from sales of three Europe segment ships, one NAA segment ship and other totaling
$340 million
Financing Activities
During 2024, net cash used in financing activities of $2.6 billion was caused by:
• Repayments of $5.4 billion of long-term debt
• Debt issuance costs of $203 million
• Debt extinguishment costs of $41 million
• Issuances of $3.1 billion of long-term debt
During 2023, net cash used in financing activities of $5.1 billion was driven by:
• Repayments of $200 million of short-term borrowings
• Repayments of $5.9 billion of long-term debt and refinancing of $1.8 billion of long-term debt to
extend maturities
• Issuances of $3.0 billion of long-term debt
• Debt issuance costs of $131 million
• Debt extinguishment costs of $79 million
• Proceeds from issuance of $22 million of Carnival Corporation common stock and purchases of
$20 million of Carnival plc ordinary shares under our Stock Swap Program
For our cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022, see “Item 7, Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2023, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on January 26, 2024.

Funding Sources
As of November 30, 2024, we had $4.2 billion of liquidity including $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents
and $2.9 billion of borrowings available under our Revolving Facility. In addition, we had $7.8 billion of
undrawn export credit facilities to fund ship deliveries planned through 2033. We plan to use existing liquidity
and future cash flows from operations to fund our cash requirements including capital expenditures not
funded by our export credit facilities. We seek to manage our credit risk exposures, including counterparty
nonperformance associated with our cash and cash equivalents, and future financing facilities by conducting
business with well-established financial institutions, and export credit agencies and diversifying our
counterparties.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
For a discussion of our hedging strategies and market risks, see the discussion below and the consolidated
financial statements.
Fuel Price Risks
Substantially all our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on
our ships.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks
Operational Currency Risks
Our operations primarily utilize the U.S. dollar, Euro, Sterling or the Australian dollar as their functional
currencies. Our operations also have revenue and expenses denominated in non-functional currencies.
Movements in foreign currency exchange rates will affect our consolidated financial statements.
52
--- PAGE 56 END ---
Investment Currency Risks
The foreign currency exchange rates were as follows:
November 30,
USD to 1: 2024 2023
A U D.................................................... $ 0.65 $ 0.66
C A D.................................................... $ 0.71 $ 0.74
E U R .................................................... $ 1.06 $ 1.10
G B P .................................................... $ 1.27 $ 1.27
If the November 30, 2023 currency exchange rates had been used to translate our November 30, 2024
non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations’ assets and liabilities (instead of the November 30, 2024 U.S.
dollar exchange rates), our total assets would have been higher by $468 million and our total liabilities
would have been higher by $408 million.
Newbuild Currency Risks
At November 30, 2024, our newbuild currency exchange rate risk primarily relates to euro-denominated
newbuild contract payments, which represent a total commitment of $8.6 billion and relate to newbuilds
scheduled to be delivered to non-euro functional currency brands. The functional currency cost of each of
these ships will increase or decrease based on changes in the exchange rates until the payments are made under
the shipbuilding contract. We may utilize foreign currency derivatives to mitigate some of this foreign
currency exchange rate risk. Based on a 1% change in euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates as of November 30,
2024, the remaining cost of these ships would have a corresponding change of $86 million.
Interest Rate Risks
The composition of our debt, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps was as follows:
November 30, 2024
F i x e dr a t e ..................................................... 6 0 %
E U Rf i x e dr a t e.................................................. 2 3 %
Floating rate ................................................... 7 %
EUR floating rate................................................ 1 0 %
At November 30, 2024, we had an interest rate swap that effectively changed $11 million of EURIBOR-
based floating rate euro debt to fixed rate euro debt. We also had interest rate swap agreements which
effectively changed $1.0 billion at November 30, 2024 of SOFR-based floating rate USD debt to fixed rate
USD debt. Based on a 100 basis point change in the market interest rates, our annual interest expense on
floating rate debt, including the effect of our interest rate swaps, will change by approximately $48 million.
